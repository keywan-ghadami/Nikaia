//! What a **compare-and-swap loop** costs against the two lock shapes, for a
//! value that fits in a machine word.
//!
//! [ADR-039](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) §3 leaves a door
//! open: `update` takes a pure function and is therefore repeatable, which is
//! the route to an implementation that retries instead of locking — the route
//! Clojure's `atom` and Haskell's `TVar` took. This measures whether walking
//! through it would pay, and **for which of the two shapes**.
//!
//! **The question is not whether lock-free wins under contention.** It does, and
//! nobody doubts it. The question is what it costs where nothing contends,
//! because that is the case a `user_parallelism = no` build is always in and
//! most values at `yes` are in as well.
//!
//! | row | what it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | `Local::update` | today's answer where nothing crosses a thread: a borrow flag, one non-atomic write |
//! | `Crossing::update` | today's answer where something may: an OS mutex with ADR-057 D4's owner check |
//! | compare-and-swap loop | the proposal: read, compute, swap, retry — **any** pure function on a word |
//! | `fetch_add` | the floor of what is possible, and what *recognising the operation* would buy over the loop |
//! | `Local::update` twice | the control. It must tie, and it bounds every difference above from below |
//!
//! The threaded rows are reported as a **sign and not a cost**
//! ([`docs/mutex-floor.md`](../../../../docs/mutex-floor.md) §4.2 is the standing
//! reason: on a shared 4-vCPU box the threaded row did not reproduce while every
//! single-threaded row did).
//!
//! ```sh
//! benches/lockfree/lockfree.sh                 # the table, 9 repeats
//! ```
