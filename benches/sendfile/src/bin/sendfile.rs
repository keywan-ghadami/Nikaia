//! What it costs to answer a request with a file, five ways.
//!
//! The question is [ADR-058](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-058.md)'s:
//! can a file reach a socket without the program reading it, and is that worth
//! a decision. There are **two families of answer**, because there are two
//! programs: one whose page is known when the server starts, and one whose file
//! the *request* names - a download route, a file server, an upload served
//! back. What may be done once outside the handler is the whole difference, and
//! the vehicles that win are not the same.
//!
//! **Named at startup.** Five vehicles serve the same file over one kept-open
//! connection the same number of times, with a thread draining the far end:
//!
//! | vehicle | what it does |
//! | :--- | :--- |
//! | `read_each` | open, read, validate, write - once per request |
//! | `cached` | read once at startup, write the buffer per request |
//! | `mapped` | `mmap` once at startup, write the mapping per request |
//! | `sendfile` | `sendfile(2)`: the program never has the bytes |
//! | `splice` | `io_uring` `Splice`, file to pipe to socket, the two linked |
//!
//! **Named by the request.** The same transfer where the path is not known
//! until the request arrives, so every vehicle pays the open. The files are
//! cycled rather than repeated, because a server whose route names a file does
//! not serve one file:
//!
//! | vehicle | what it does per request |
//! | :--- | :--- |
//! | `read_named` | open, read, write, close |
//! | `mapped_named` | open, `mmap`, write, `munmap`, close |
//! | `sendfile_named` | open, `fstat`, `sendfile`, close |
//! | `mapped_kept` | a lookup in a table of mappings made once - the hot set a real file server keeps |
//!
//! **The column that answers is `machine`, not `thread`.** The sending thread
//! is not the whole cost: the reader drains the far end, and `io_uring`
//! performs a splice on kernel workers no per-thread accounting sees - which
//! is why `splice`'s thread column is flat at ~20 µs while the machine pays
//! three times what `sendfile` costs. Machine-wide busy time from `/proc/stat`
//! is what a server operator is billed for, and the box is otherwise quiet.
