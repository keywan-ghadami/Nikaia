//! What the **boxed future** costs a handler that does not pause
//! ([ADR-122](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-122.md) D3).
//!
//! D1 made a parameter whose type may pause lower to a closure returning a
//! boxed future — `impl Fn(A) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = R>>>` — whether the
//! callee runs it or keeps it, and D3 said that number is measured rather than
//! assumed. **The *whether* is gone since
//! [ADR-192](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-192.md) D1**: a **run**
//! parameter takes `impl AsyncFn(A) -> R` and only a **kept** one keeps the
//! box, because `AsyncFn` is a bound and a field needs a type. What the rows
//! below measure is therefore what each of the two shapes costs, rather than a
//! cost one case was paying for the other.
//!
//! | row | what it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | plain closure | what `fn(i64) -> i64 sync` lowers to: `impl Fn(i64) -> i64` |
//! | boxed future | what `fn(i64) -> i64` lowers to, awaited by the same executor a program uses |
//! | async closure | what `fn(i64) -> i64` lowers to at a **run** parameter: `impl AsyncFn(i64) -> i64` |
//! | plain closure, twice | the control. It must tie, and it bounds the difference above from below |
//!
//! **The third row is why this bench outlived its record**
//! ([ADR-187](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-187.md) D1,
//! [ADR-192](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-192.md) D1). D1 chose the
//! boxed future because *"Rust has no stable `async` closure"*, and that is
//! false on this toolchain and was false when it was written. The row was added
//! so the alternative would be a number rather than an argument; it is now what
//! a run parameter costs, and the **second** row is what a kept one does.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p handler-bench --release --bin handler
//! ```
//!
//! **What it is not.** It is not a claim about a handler that *does* pause:
//! there the plain closure is not a shape at all, so the floor is a reference
//! point and not an alternative. What the three rows compare is the two shapes
//! a pausing parameter can take against the one a `sync` parameter takes.
