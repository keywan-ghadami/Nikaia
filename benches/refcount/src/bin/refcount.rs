//! What an atomic reference count costs, against a plain one.
//!
//! [ADR-037](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D3 expands `Shared`
//! from `user_parallelism`: `no` gives `Rc`, `yes` gives `Arc`. Whether that
//! choice could be made **per value** instead is left open there, and the
//! question is only worth machinery if the atomic is worth avoiding. So this
//! measures the thing the inference would buy, before the inference exists.
//!
//! Six shapes, all on one thread except the last two, each run as a pair so the
//! only difference inside a pair is the reference count:
//!
//! | shape | what it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | `clone+drop` | a handle cloned and dropped — one increment and one decrement, and nothing else |
//! | `read` | the value read through the handle, no handle made — the control: no count is touched, so the pair must be a tie |
//! | `clone+work(k)` | the same clone and drop with `k` multiply-adds between them — what the atomic is as a *share* of a loop that does something |
//! | `counter` | Part II 12.2's `Shared[Locked[i32]]` increment: `Rc<RefCell<i32>>` against `Arc<Mutex<i32>>`. Both halves of the expansion move together here, which is the finding this shape exists for |
//! | `clone+drop, N threads, own handle` | the same atomic with no sharing: N threads each cloning a handle of their own |
//! | `clone+drop, N threads, one handle` | N threads on **one** count — the cache line that makes an atomic expensive rather than merely atomic |
//!
//! `read` is the one that says whether the harness is measuring anything: `Rc`
//! and `Arc` deref identically, so a difference there is noise and bounds every
//! other difference from below.
//!
//! ```sh
//! benches/refcount/refcount.sh                 # the table, 9 repeats
//! cargo run -p refcount-bench --release --bin refcount -- 20000000 9
//! ```
//!
//! Every repeat is printed, because a single number without its spread is not a
//! measurement (`benches/overlap/README.md`), and
//! [`docs/runtime-cost.md`](../../../../docs/runtime-cost.md) §6.3 is why only
//! the ratios here are load-bearing.
