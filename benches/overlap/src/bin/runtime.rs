//! What a pair of operations costs on the runtime that is already running.
//!
//! This is the measurement [ADR-038](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md)
//! D4 predicts and [ADR-033](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-033.md) §8.5
//! wrote down as a prediction it could not time: an I/O thread that is already
//! running costs nothing per operation, where the vehicle §8.4 measured costs
//! a thread wake-up per pair - **46 µs, and no user-space vehicle removes it**.
//!
//! Three shapes over the same two files, so the difference between them is the
//! vehicle and nothing else:
//!
//! | shape | what it is |
//! |---|---|
//! | `seq` | one read, then the other, both through `std::fs` - the baseline |
//! | `join` | `nikaia_std::task::both`, which is `rayon::join`: §8.4's vehicle |
//! | `both` | `nikaia_std::fs::read_both`: both in flight on the pre-started runtime |
//!
//! The number that answers D4 is **`join - seq` against `both - seq`**: what
//! each vehicle adds for overlapping a pair whose payload is small enough that
//! the payload is not the answer. Every shape reads the same bytes through the
//! same `std`, so nothing but the vehicle differs.
//!
//! ```sh
//! benches/overlap/runtime.sh              # the table, over five file sizes
//! cargo run -p overlap-bench --release --bin runtime -- 5000 7
//! ```
//!
//! The second argument is how many times the whole measurement is repeated;
//! every repeat is printed, because a single number without its spread is not
//! a measurement (`benches/overlap/README.md`).
