# ADR-033 D10's number, end to end: what the *lowering* costs, not what the
# `std` function costs.
#
# `runtime.sh` measures `nikaia_std` from Rust. This measures a `.nika` program
# through the whole pipeline - the analysis, the emitter, `cargo`, the runtime -
# at `user_parallelism = no`, against the same program lowered with
# `--ordering strict`. Two binaries, one source, and the only difference between
# them is the pair.
#
# Both of ADR-038 D3's mechanisms are measured, because D10's decision is about
# the second one: on the completion path a pair is free, and on the fallback the
# pair is performed in written order rather than for ~38 µs a pair. The
# fallback's column is therefore the check that the decision is in the code.
#
# See README.md for the method and docs/runtime-cost.md §6 for the numbers.
