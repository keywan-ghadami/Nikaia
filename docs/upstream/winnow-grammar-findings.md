# Findings for `winnow-grammar`

What Nikaia's use of the parser backend turned up, with a reproduction for each.
Recorded here so it is not re-discovered, and so it can be handed over as one
piece. Measured against `2f0d5da` and `024e3d3`.

---

## 1. Two expectations beat one, and the one is thrown away

### 1a. Every Nikaia error names whitespace instead of the token that would fix it

```nika
struct S {
    name: &str
    temp i32          // comma missing
}
```

```
expected one of: `//`, whitespace; found unexpected token `temp` at line 3, column 5
in COMMENT / in item 1 / in WS / in struct_item / in item / in program
```

Both expectations are **true** — whitespace and a comment really are accepted
there. But `,` is the only one whose insertion fixes the program, and it is
gone. This is every syntax error in the language, not a corner case.

Cause: `WS = (WSE | COMMENT)*` fails with two expectations, so `merge` raises it
to `PRIO_AGGREGATED (20)`. The real expectation has one, so `PRIO_NORMAL (0)`.
At equal offset `merge` returns the higher-priority side and **discards** the
other; the union happens only on a tie.

Nikaia cannot avoid it: comments need at least two alternatives in `WS`, and
there is no formulation with one. `tests/comment_aware_test.rs` is line for line
what Nikaia writes, so this reaches every grammar that supports comments.

### 1b. It is not about comments, and not about whitespace

No custom `WS`, no comments, no trivia of any kind:

```rust
grammar! {
    grammar G {
        pub rule doc -> usize = xs:item* "." -> { xs.len() }
        rule item -> u32 = n:u32 -> { n } | "#" h:hex_digit1 -> { 0 }
    }
}
// G::parse_doc().parse_test("1 2 x")
```

```
expected one of: `#`, integer literal; found unexpected token `x`
```

**`.` is missing** — the token that ends the document and fixes the input. Here
the repetition's own expectations are the useful ones and must stay, so the
answer cannot be to suppress a repetition's reason for stopping. It has to be
to stop discarding.

The general statement: **any rule with two or more alternatives suppresses every
single-expectation error at the same offset.** In a language grammar that is
most error positions — expressions, statements and items all have many
alternatives. The implicit whitespace skip is only the most frequent instance,
because the code generator puts it between every pair of tokens.

### A shape that fits both

The criterion is not taste. **An expectation is worth reporting only if
satisfying it can move the parse past this position.** Whitespace fails it: the
skip is greedy and has already taken everything available at this offset, so
inserting more produces the same failure at offset + n. Telling the reader
"expected whitespace" asks them to make an edit that cannot work.

That criterion has a mechanical form, and the code already draws the line —
`repeat_recording_bounded`, one branch:

```rust
Err(ErrMode::Backtrack(e)) => {
    let e = e.item(items.len() + 1);
    if items.len() < min {
        return Err(ErrMode::Backtrack(e));   // required: the error itself
    }
    e.record(&mut input.state);              // optional: merely recorded
    input.reset(&cp);
    break;
}
```

An error that is **returned** is a requirement: the grammar demanded something
here. An error that is **recorded** by a repetition that has met its minimum,
or by `opt_recording`, is an **optional continuation**: the grammar would have
accepted more and does not insist. `x+` below its minimum returns, so it stays
a requirement — which is why nothing here suppresses a repetition.

So the ranking needs no new classification, no declaration and no magic rule
names:

1. **Headline** — the requirements at the furthest offset.
2. **Note** — the optional continuations.
3. **Dropped** — an optional continuation that is whitespace, by the criterion
   above. (A *required* whitespace — `space1` below its minimum — is returned,
   so it is a requirement and stays.)

And the two changes are still independent: **stop discarding** (union at equal
offset instead of returning one side, with `fail(…)` and labels staying
authoritative), and **rank by requirement rather than by how many alternatives
an error happens to carry**.

Worked through:

| input | today | proposed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `temp i32` in a struct | `expected one of: '//', whitespace` | `expected '}'` — note: also possible: `,`, `//` |
| `1 2 x` against `item* "."` | `expected one of: '#', integer literal` | `expected '.'` — note: also possible: `#`, integer literal |
| ` /broken comment` | whatever is required, with `//` discarded | `expected …` — note: also possible: `//` |

The struct line is the honest one rather than the ideal one, and worth saying
plainly: at that position the grammar does **not** require a comma. It requires
`}` or accepts another field, and a parser cannot know the author meant the
second. `expected '}'` with `,` in the note is true and complete; guessing the
intent is not on offer.

This also subsumes "deprioritise comments for now": a comment is an optional
continuation, so it lands in the note by construction, with no special case for
it and no list of rule names anywhere.

A near-miss — the found input sharing a prefix with a trivia expectation, `/`
against `//` — would promote that expectation to the headline and is the one
place a heuristic would earn its keep. It is a refinement of this, not a
prerequisite.

**What it costs to implement.** `state.furthest` is one `ParseError`, so keeping
requirements and optional continuations apart needs either a flag per
expectation or a second slot. That is the whole of it; the classification itself
is free, being a branch the runtime already takes.

### Against the existing tests in `tests/diagnostics.rs`

| | why it is unaffected |
| :--- | :--- |
| p06 `let ?;` → `expected one of: number, string` | the label is authoritative; nothing unions into it |
| p07 `let "abc;` → the label's own message stays | the two errors are at **different offsets** — the string alternative made progress — so the offset comparison decides before priority is consulted |
| p08 `fail(..)` wins on a tie | authoritative; `headline()` returns `message` |
| p09 progress beats `fail(..)` | offset first, unchanged |

**Not verified against the full suite.** Cargo fingerprints a git dependency on
its commit, so editing the vendored checkout has no effect, and this is a design
plus two reproductions plus a reading of four tests — not a tested patch.

## 2. The word-at-a-time class scan loses below ~6-8 characters

ADR 23's changelog entry says of the eight-bytes-at-a-time scan: *"on the short
runs a real format has it is smaller but never negative."* On 1BRC's
`digit{1,2}` and `digit` it is negative.

**The mechanism, before the numbers.** `AsciiClass::out_mask` costs a fixed
~13 operations per 8-byte word for a one-range class (`digit`): build `guarded`
(2), two `splat`+`wrapping_sub`+`&HIGH` (~8), combine (3). With `run`'s loop
head, `try_into`, `trailing_zeros`, the divide, and `class`'s `as_bstr` and
`next_slice`, a call is **~30 instructions regardless of run length**. A
per-character loop costs ~4-5 *per character*. Break-even is therefore around
six to eight characters, and a one-character run cannot come out ahead: a
13-operation word test is not cheaper than a 1-operation character test.

**Then the numbers**, `examples/1brc.nika --profile lite`, callgrind over
200 000 rows, same source, same flags, identical output. All four are simulator
outputs, so they do not depend on the machine:

| | `2f0d5da` | `024e3d3` | Δ |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| instructions | 131.2 M | 143.9 M | +12.7 M |
| branches | 16.49 M | 17.25 M | +0.76 M |
| **mispredicts** | 653 026 | 638 959 | **−14 067** |
| D1 misses | 207 908 | 209 753 | +1 845 |
| LL misses | 55 723 | 55 187 | −536 |

The scan does what a word scan is supposed to do — it buys fewer mispredicts
with more instructions. It is the size of the trade that is wrong: 14 067
mispredicts at ~20 cycles is ~0.28 M cycles won, against 12.7 M instructions at
a generous IPC of 4, ~3.2 M cycles paid. **About elevenfold against.** Both
approximations lean the same way: IPC 4 is an upper bound so the cost is a lower
bound, and a simulated predictor is simpler than a real one so the saving is if
anything overstated.

Instruction counts alone would have been the wrong measurement here, and for
exactly this kind of change — that is why the branch and cache columns are in
the table.

The scan path itself: 40 → 106 instructions per row (`take_till0` → `rt::class`),
which is the whole of the +63 per-row difference.

This is a threshold, not a regression to undo: ADR 23's own +9 % on
identifier-heavy grammars is entirely plausible, identifiers being 5-15
characters. The code generator knows `{1,2}` at compile time, so an upper bound
below break-even could take the character path. Where the crossover sits is a
measurement for the machines that matter, not for a VM.

## 3. `dec(p)` and `text(p)` cannot appear inside a `#[frame]`

`builtin_may_consume` has no arm for them, so `_ => true` says they consume
anything, and the frame check rejects:

```
error: the built-in `dec` in rule `TENTHS` can consume the boundary "\n" of
frame `MEASUREMENT`
```

`intern` is already excepted, with the reasoning that applies unchanged to
both:

> `intern(p)` consumes exactly what `p` consumes and nothing besides: it is a
> map over its argument, and the argument is checked on its own in the
> `RuleCall` arm above.

`text(p)` is `.take()` over its argument and `dec<T>(p)` is a `try_map` over the
same sequence; neither consumes anything its argument does not.

Reproduction: `examples/1brc.nika` with `whole:dec[i32](digit{1,2})`. It compiles
and runs correctly under `@frame(…, unchecked)`, which is how the measurement in
[ADR-011](../specification/adr/adr-011.md) §4 was taken.

---

## 4. The intern cache is sized for identifiers, not for aggregation

Not a defect — an assumption worth making settable. `InternCache` is 512
direct-mapped slots and says so plainly: *"There is no collision handling
because there is nothing to handle - a displaced entry is simply interned
again."* Right for a compiler's identifier stream, where a few words are hot.

1BRC has 413 distinct keys, so displacement is the common case and every miss
falls through to `ThreadedRodeo` — a shard lock and a hash, ~2.5x a cache hit.
Measured, keying the station table by `Symbol` and indexing a `Vec` instead of
hashing a `&str`:

| keys | intern cache + `Vec` index | plain map, fast hash |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 15 | 507 instructions/row | 512 |
| 413 | **617** | 514 |

The map is flat and the cache degrades. Making `InternCache::BITS` settable per
context would close it: how many distinct keys a parse will see is the caller's
knowledge, not the library's.
