# Open decisions — the questions that need the owner

## The shape this page is for
The
entries here are written to be *answerable* — what is blocked, the options, a
recommendation, and what either direction costs if it is wrong.

An answer is an [ADR](specification/adr/), and
the moment a question is answered its entry leaves this file rather than
staying with a note on it. What is merely **unbuilt** is in
[`open-work.md`](open-work.md). Each entry says what the
question is, why it is the owner's, and what this file recommends.

**What is here is what has been asked**, which is not the same as what is
unsettled: an entry is here because a piece of work was blocked by it and somebody
noticed, so an empty page means nothing is blocked that anyone has written down.
The way to refill it is the paragraph above — the moment a piece of work is
blocked by a question, the question comes here in that shape.

## Open

Nothing. The last question here — *does the language have a type for a list of
errors?* — was answered by [ADR-210](specification/adr/adr-210.md): no; the
joined failures are a diagnostic, not a value.
