"""The roadmap's percentages are counted from its own boxes, or they are a mood.

`docs/project_status_and_roadmap.md` opens with a table saying how far along four
areas are. That table is the one thing on the page nothing else would catch going
stale: every box below it is a sentence somebody edits, and the number at the top
is a sentence nobody re-derives. The file's own history is the argument — the
order used to live twice, and the copy that went stale is the one that was not
checked.

So this recounts the boxes and compares. A box is `[x]` done, `[~]` part-built
(a half) or `[ ]` open; which area it belongs to is decided by the headings the
table itself names, and a box this cannot place is an error rather than a
silently-absent one.
