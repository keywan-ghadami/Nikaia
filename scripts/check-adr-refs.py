"""Every `ADR-0NN Dn` / `ADR-0NN §x` citation must point at a heading that exists,
and every ADR number belongs to exactly one record.

A decision is only citable if the number is stable, so a dangling `D7` is a
defect in the same way a dangling link is. Run from the repository root; exits
non-zero and lists what is dangling.

**The second check is here because the first one missed a collision.** Two
sessions claimed 074 on the same afternoon and the second overwrote the first
record's file - every citation still resolved, because the file was still
there and still had a `D1`. What the repository did notice, and nobody read,
was the index: it carried **two rows for 074**, one per record. So that is what
is checked - one index row per number, one file per number, and the file's own
title agreeing with its name. A claim in the reserved table is a promise between
people; this is the part a machine can keep.
