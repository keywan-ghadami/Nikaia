//! Files read and written by the kernel through `io_uring`, and the bell that
//! wakes a thread parked on the ring. Linux only.
//!
//! Every `unsafe` in this crate, and the argument for it, is listed in
//! `README.md`; the soundness rule for the buffers is below.
//!
//! ## Files, completed by the kernel
//! (Nikaia ADR-038 D3).
//!
//! `epoll` cannot read a file at all: a regular file is always "ready" and the
//! read blocks in the kernel anyway, which is why every readiness-based
//! runtime serves file I/O from a thread pool - and that pool *is*
//! Nikaia ADR-033 §8.4's 46 µs.
//! `io_uring` removes it, not by being a faster pool but because no thread is
//! involved: the kernel performs the read and reports when it is done.
//!
//! ## The soundness rule, and how it is met
//!
//! A buffer handed to the kernel must stay alive and unmoved until the
//! completion for it arrives. The rule this file follows is one sentence:
//!
//! > **A slot, and the buffer in it, is freed only by the code that has
//! > reaped its completion.**
//!
//! Three things make that hold rather than hope for it.
//!
//! 1. **The buffers are not on any caller's stack.** A [`Job`] lives in
//!    `Ring::jobs`, and the `Ring` lives in the process-global runtime
//!    (the runtime that owns the `Ring`), which outlives every frame in the program. An unwind
//!    through `read_many` therefore cannot drop a buffer the kernel holds -
//!    there is nothing on that stack to drop.
//! 2. **A slot is released on a count, not on a return.** `Job::outstanding`
//!    is the number of submissions for that slot whose completion has not been
//!    reaped. The slot is cleared when it reaches zero and at no other moment,
//!    so an operation abandoned half-way leaves its buffer where the kernel
//!    left it.
//! 3. **The next operation reconciles before it submits.** [`Ring::reconcile`]
//!    reaps whatever an abandoned call left behind, which is what makes a slot
//!    reusable *after* its completion rather than after its caller gave up.
//!
//! What the language contributes is that there is never a borrowed buffer to
//! hand over in the first place. `fs::read` and `fs::read_to_string` return
//! **owned** values, so `std` allocates the buffer, moves it into the slot,
//! and moves the finished bytes out again - and `fs::map`, the one function
//! here that hands back memory it does not own, is a mapping and never
//! reaches the ring. Ownership is what
//! Nikaia ADR-005 and
//! Nikaia ADR-008's tether lattice
//! infer, and it is what the kernel is handed.
//!
//! ## What is *not* completed here
//!
//! `open` and `stat` are ordinary blocking syscalls. They are a path walk in
//! the kernel with no data transfer, they are what the measurement's baseline
//! pays too, and putting them on the ring would buy a syscall rather than a
//! thread. The *read* is what ADR-033 §8.4 priced, and the read is what
//! completes.
