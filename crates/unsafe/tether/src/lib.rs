//! Views that outlive the scope that read their buffer.
//!
//! A view of text is a plain `&str`. When views have to outlive the local that
//! read the buffer, the buffer moves somewhere that lives as long as they do:
//!
//! * [`Keep`] — an append-only home for buffers; every buffer in it stays at
//!   its address until the `Keep` is dropped.
//! * [`forever`] — a `Keep` behind an `Arc`, borrowed for as long as a clone of
//!   the `Arc` travels beside what is derived from it.
//! * [`Held`] — one view of text carrying its own handle on the buffer, for a
//!   container that drops entries while it keeps reading.
//! * [`Holding`] — a whole struct of views carrying a handle on each buffer it
//!   points into, with a **safe** constructor: the struct is built inside a
//!   closure that is handed the keeps and nothing else with a lifetime it
//!   could keep, so every view in it provably points into them.
//! * [`Keeps`] / [`Rebase`] / [`Hold`] — how a value made *outside* such a
//!   closure is carried in: each view is found again in the keep it points
//!   into ([`Keep::view`]), checked by address, so a view that points anywhere
//!   else becomes a copy the keep owns rather than a dangling reference.
//!
//! Every `unsafe` in this crate, and the argument for it, is listed in
//! `README.md`.
