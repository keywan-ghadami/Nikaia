# tether

Views that outlive the scope that read their buffer, without copying the text.

| type | what it is |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Keep` | an append-only home for buffers; a buffer stays at its address until the `Keep` is dropped |
| `forever` | a `Keep` behind an `Arc`, borrowed as long as the program runs — for a handle that travels beside what is derived from it |
| `Keep::put_viewed` / `Keep::view` | a buffer views of text are cut from (`Viewed`), and a view found again in it **by address** — or, where it points into no buffer of the keep, a copy the keep owns |
| `Held` | one view of text carrying its own handle on its buffer; compared, hashed and printed as the text; a **safe** constructor |
| `Holding<V, N>` / `Views` | a struct of views beside the `N` keeps it points into, with a **safe** constructor |
| `Keeps` / `Rebase` / `Hold` | how a value made *outside* the constructor is carried in: each view found again in its keep |
| `Dangling<T>` | storage for a value whose views are stretched, beside the handle that keeps their buffer — what anything derived through `forever` must be kept in |

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use tether::{Holding, Keep, Views};

struct Record<'a> { name: &'a str, size: usize }
enum RecordViews {}
impl Views for RecordViews {
    type Of<'a> = Record<'a>;
    fn shorten<'long: 's, 's>(x: &'s Record<'long>) -> &'s Record<'s> { x }
}

let keep = Arc::new(Keep::new());
let text = keep.put_viewed(String::from("  oslo  "));
// Made the ordinary way, borrowing `text` ...
let name = text.trim();
// ... and carried in: `k.view` finds `name` in the keep by its address.
let held: Holding<RecordViews> =
    Holding::new([Arc::clone(&keep)], |k| Record { name: k.view(name), size: text.len() });
drop(keep);
assert_eq!(held.get().name, "oslo");
```

No dependencies. Written for the Nikaia compiler's generated code, usable by
anything that needs the same.

## Every `unsafe`, and why it is sound

| where | what | why it holds |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Dangling::get`, `Dangling::drop` | `MaybeUninit::assume_init_ref` / `assume_init_drop` | the value is written in `new` and taken apart only in `drop`, once |
| `Keep::put`, `Keep::put_viewed` | `&*at` from `Arc::as_ptr` | the `Arc` is pushed and never removed until the `Keep` is dropped, so the buffer stays alive and in place; the reference is tied to the borrow of the `Keep` |
| `Keep::find` | `&*Arc::as_ptr` of a stored buffer, beyond the lock | the same argument as `put`: the `Arc` stays until the `Keep` is dropped, so the buffer may be borrowed for as long as the `Keep` is rather than the lock |
| `within` (inside `find`) | `str::from_utf8_unchecked` | the bytes are found **by address**: they are the very bytes the `&str` asked about is made of, so they are UTF-8 |
| `forever` (an `unsafe fn`) | `&*Arc::as_ptr(keep)` as `'static` | the caller's contract: everything derived is dropped before the last clone of the `Arc` |
| `Held::new` | `&str` → `&'static str` | the view came from `Keep::find` or `Keep::view`, which hand back nothing but a view of that keep's own buffers, and the clone of the keep stored beside it keeps them alive |
| `Holding::new`, `Holding::clone` | `transmute_copy` of `V::Of<'_>` to `V::Of<'static>` | the closure must work for every lifetime and is handed only the keeps, so the struct can point only into them or at `'static` data; it is private, dropped before the keeps, and handed out only through `get`, which shortens it back |

**Two things the compiler checks for the caller**, so neither is a comment:

* `Views::shorten`'s body is `x`, which compiles only where the struct is
  **covariant** in its lifetime. A struct that could be written through
  (`Cell<&'a str>`, `&'a mut`) is refused there.
* `Holding::new`'s closure is `for<'a> FnOnce(Keeps<'a, N>) -> V::Of<'a>`, so a
  view of anything but the keeps (a local, a captured borrow) is refused. A
  view made outside comes in only through `Keeps::view`, which checks where it
  points.

**What is no longer here: `hold`.** An `unsafe fn` whose caller promised the
view pointed into the keep. `Held::new` asks the keep instead, so the promise is
checked rather than trusted, and generated code writes no `unsafe` for a held
view.

**Why `Dangling`.** A struct holding a `&'static str` promises that the text is
valid wherever the struct goes; passed by value into a function, the reference
is taken to be valid for the whole call. `Held`, `Holding` and a value packed
beside a `forever` handle drop their value *before* the buffer, possibly inside
such a call, so the promise must not be made: the value lives in a
`MaybeUninit`, which makes none. Miri found both this and the `Box` in
`Keep::put` (moving a `Box` invalidates references into it; an `Arc` does not).

## How it is checked

It is its own workspace, so its lock file, its checks and the toolchain for
them are its own:

```sh
cd crates/unsafe/tether
cargo test                                                   # stable
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo +nightly miri test                                     # Stacked Borrows
MIRIFLAGS=-Zmiri-tree-borrows cargo +nightly miri test       # Tree Borrows
```

`scripts/check-unsafe-crates.sh` runs all four for every crate under
`crates/unsafe/`, and CI runs that script.
