//! Wrapping Cargo: the generated `Cargo.toml`, and the `rustc` interception.
//!
//! [ADR-002](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-002.md) D1 decides this and
//! [ADR-003](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-003.md) D2 decides where it
//! lives: the CLI wrapping and the Cargo instrumentation are the *generic*
//! half, so nothing below knows what a `.nika` file is. A frontend hands over a
//! package description and the extension its own sources carry; this renders
//! the manifest, runs `cargo`, and rewrites one argument on the way to `rustc`.
//!
//! Three properties are what the whole thing rests on, and each was measured
//! against a real `cargo` rather than assumed:
//!
//! * **`RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` reaches workspace members only.** That is the
//!   point of choosing it over `RUSTC_WRAPPER`: a dependency from crates.io is
//!   compiled by the real `rustc`, untouched, and the language's pipeline never
//!   sees a crate it did not write.
//! * **A generated file is only written when it changed** ([`write_if_changed`]).
//!   Cargo decides freshness by comparing mtimes against the fingerprint it
//!   wrote last time, so a generated source rewritten unconditionally is a
//!   package that is dirty on every build, for ever.
//! * **The source `cargo` thinks it compiled is not the source the user
//!   edited**, so the dependency file `rustc` emits names the wrong input.
//!   [`record_extra_dependencies`] puts the real ones back, and without it a
//!   changed source would not rebuild.
