//! A count a `std` entry takes, converted where it has to be.
//!
//! **The other direction of [ADR-048](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-048.md)
//! D1.** That record made what a length *returns* an `i64` and left what a
//! parameter *takes* open, saying so; this is the answer
//! ([ADR-054](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-054.md) D2). The ledger writes
//! such a parameter as the `i64` a program can hold, and the conversion is
//! emitted rather than written - exactly as `index::at` is at an index.
//!
//! **Why it is not `index::at`.** The conversion is the same and the failure is
//! not. A negative index *is* an access out of bounds and reports as one, which
//! is what let D1 emit it without inventing a failure mode. A negative count is
//! no such thing: `"ab".repeat(-1)` is not an access at all, so it needs a
//! message of its own and gets one.
//!
//! **Why a trait.** The emitter does not know types (ADR-011 D2): it sees a
//! method name and an argument. So this is chosen by the type of what is passed,
//! and is the **identity** for anything that is not a signed integer - which is
//! what makes it safe to write around every call of that name, including a
//! method of the program's own that happens to share it.
