//! What goes between the brackets, converted where it has to be.
//!
//! **A length is an `i64`** ([ADR-048](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-048.md)
//! D1), so `for i in 0..xs.len()` gives an `i64` and `xs[i]` is an `i64` index.
//! Rust indexes a sequence by `usize`, and this is the conversion - emitted, never
//! written. D1's trade is that the ceremony a user would write cannot fail while
//! the conversion the compiler writes can, in one direction only: a **negative**
//! index.
//!
//! **A negative index reports as an access out of bounds**, which D1 requires: it
//! *is* one, and a diagnostic about a failed conversion would be about something
//! the user did not write. `as usize` would not do - `-3 as usize` is
//! 18446744073709551613, and the message a reader gets is then about a number
//! nothing in their program contains.
//!
//! **Why a trait and not a function.** The emitter puts this around *every* index
//! it writes, because it does not know types (ADR-011 D2) and a map is indexed
//! too: `counts[path]` takes a `&str`. So the conversion has to be chosen by the
//! type of what is in the brackets, and choosing on a type is what a trait is. For
//! anything that is not an integer this is the identity, which is why a uniform
//! rule is safe here - and a uniform rule is the one that cannot be applied to the
//! wrong index.
