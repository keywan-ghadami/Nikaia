//! **HTTP/1.1's text half**, as far as the MVP's protocol goes
//! ([ADR-194](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-194.md) D5).
//!
//! `GET` and `POST`, bodies by `Content-Length`, `Connection: close`, no
//! chunked transfer and no TLS. That record's own scope, and its own staging:
//! **the parser is Rust here and moving it into a Nikaia grammar is a later
//! step** — self-hosting the protocol is not the MVP, and the route it will
//! take when it moves is [ADR-196](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-196.md)
//! D2's.
//!
//! **Not named `http`**, and that is not a taste: a program reaches a *package*
//! by that word ([ADR-069](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-069.md) D1), and
//! a `std` module of the same name would make `http::Response` mean two things.
//! `std`'s own ledger says what happens the day a crate's word collides with a
//! module's — *that is a refusal to write* — and this is the day not to create
//! one.
//!
//! ## Where the line between this and a package runs
//!
//! This module holds **framing**: where a head ends, what its lines say, and
//! how many bytes of body the head promised. A package holds **meaning**: what
//! a path is for, what a handler is, what goes back. `Buffer` is on this side
//! of the line because deciding that a head has not arrived yet is reading
//! HTTP/1.1, not reading a request.
//!
//! It reaches no socket. A program reads bytes with `net` and hands them here,
//! which is why every function below is `sync`: a server calls them between two
//! steps that do pause, and neither of them is this.
//!
//! ## What it refuses, and why a refusal is the feature
//!
//! A head longer than the cap, a `Content-Length` that is not a number, a
//! request line that is not three words. Each is a **400** or a **431** rather
//! than a guess: [ADR-010](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-010.md) D2 says
//! these bytes are somebody else's, and a parser that guessed at them would be
//! guessing on their behalf.
