//! Nikaia's `std`, as far as Stage 0 needs it.
//!
//! A transpiler has to answer "what is `fs::map`" somewhere, and the two places
//! it could are a table inside the emitter or a crate the generated program
//! links against. This is the second, because it makes the answer readable: the
//! semantics of `std::fs` are code with tests, not string substitutions in a
//! printer (ADR-013).
//!
//! What is here is exactly what `examples/1brc.nika` reaches for, and nothing
//! is stubbed: every function does what the specification says it does, or it
//! is not here at all.
//!
//! Some of it is written in Nikaia (ADR-014 D1). The `.nika` source is the one
//! to edit; the `.rs` beside it is what the Stage 0 compiler lowered it to, is
//! committed, and is what the modules below include. **This crate has no build
//! dependency on the compiler** and must not grow one: building `std` needs
//! nothing but `rustc` (ADR-002 D4). `nikaia lower-std` regenerates the `.rs`,
//! and `crates/nikaia/tests/sysroot.rs` fails if what is committed has drifted
//! from what the compiler produces.
