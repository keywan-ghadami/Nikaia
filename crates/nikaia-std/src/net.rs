//! `std::net` — the socket `std` lends, so a Nikaia package can speak a
//! protocol over it
//! ([ADR-194](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-194.md) D1).
//!
//! [ADR-069](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-069.md) D2's subtraction,
//! carried one item further: what was pushed out of `std` is the *protocol and
//! the framework*, and a socket is neither. It is an operating-system resource
//! of exactly the kind `fs` and `io` already own, and the `http` package is
//! Nikaia and cannot make a syscall.
//!
//! ## What pauses, and on what
//!
//! Everything that waits. `accept`, `read` and `write` give the thread up
//! rather than holding it: the socket is non-blocking, and where the kernel
//! says *not yet* this asks
//! [`crate::rt::io::waiting`]([ADR-121](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-121.md)
//! D4) for readiness and awaits it. That is the same park `fs` uses and the
//! same one a task uses, so one thread serves many connections at
//! `user_parallelism = no` exactly as it does at `yes`.
//!
//! `bind` and `connect` are the two that do **not**. Binding is a syscall that
//! answers immediately; connecting is not, and this one blocks on it — stated
//! rather than hidden, because what the MVP connects to is a listener on the
//! same machine ([ADR-194](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-194.md) D5) and a
//! non-blocking connect is a second readiness shape for a case nothing here
//! has yet.
//!
//! ## What comes out of it is **untrusted**
//!
//! [ADR-010](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-010.md) D2, and this is the
//! first source in `std` that is: every other one is the operator's own — a
//! file they named, a pipe they connected, the arguments they typed. `std`'s
//! own ledger predicted this one by name.
