//! `Bytes`: one shared buffer, and the thing a view of a file points into.
//!
//! Part III 17.2 says what it is: *`read` returns `Bytes`, not a `Vec[u8]`: it
//! is one shared buffer, and slices that outlive its scope are tethered to it
//! (Part I 6.6)*. Both halves of that sentence matter here and only the first
//! is this file's: a `Bytes` is a reference-counted run of bytes, so handing
//! one on costs a count rather than a copy. The second half — a slice that
//! *outlives* the buffer's scope — is the tether, which is not built, and the
//! compiler refuses the programs that would need it (`NK2303`) rather than
//! letting them reach this type.
//!
//! `Arc<[u8]>` and not `Arc<Vec<u8>>`: one allocation and one indirection, and
//! the buffer is immutable once it exists, which is what lets a clone be a
//! count. A program that wants to *build* bytes builds a `Vec[u8]` and hands it
//! over, which is the `From` below and the one copy in the whole type.
