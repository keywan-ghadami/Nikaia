//! What `Locked[T]` is in the machine — two shapes behind one surface
//! ([ADR-057](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-057.md)).
//!
//! **The shape is decided per value and not per build setting** (D1–D3): where
//! `contracts::sharing` proves that nothing crosses a thread with a value, its
//! lock is [`Local`]; where it does not, and at every value that does cross, it
//! is [`Crossing`]. The floor is the one that is safe, exactly as the reference
//! count's floor is the atomic one.
//!
//! **Both say the same thing when a program re-enters one lock** (D4), and that
//! is what the crossing shape pays its owner check for. A borrow flag says so by
//! itself; a bare `Mutex` would hang for ever without saying anything, and at one
//! user thread a hang is the whole program plus
//! [ADR-006](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-006.md) D5's shutdown deadline.
//! Two behaviours for one written type, picked by an analysis the reader cannot
//! see, is the thing D4 refuses.
//!
//! **Neither is a pause.** `access` takes a lambda that runs straight through
//! ([ADR-005](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-005.md) D6), so nothing is held
//! across a suspension point and a wait here is bounded by somebody else's
//! compute rather than by somebody else's waiting.
