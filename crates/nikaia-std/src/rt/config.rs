//! The runtime configuration file, read at startup
//! ([ADR-038](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D5).
//!
//! Four settings and no fifth. They are read when the program starts, by the
//! person running it on the machine it runs on - which is why they are *not*
//! `nikaia.toml` keys: a build-time value cannot be tuned by an operator, who
//! is not the person who compiled it. `nikaia.toml` keeps what the compiler
//! must know (`target` and `user_parallelism`,
//! [ADR-037](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D5) and nothing
//! else.
//!
//! | key | what it decides | default |
//! | :--- | :--- | :--- |
//! | `io-workers` | how many I/O threads run | `1` |
//! | `user-pool` | how large the pool for user code is, at `user_parallelism = yes` | `0` = as many as the machine has |
//! | `io-method` | which mechanism serves a file: `auto`, `uring`, `blocking` | `auto` |
//! | `cleanup-deadline` | how long shutdown drains before cancelling the rest | `30s` |
//!
//! `io-method`'s default is `auto` and it can be pinned - the same shape
//! `--ordering strict` has: the default decides, and a person may overrule it
//! to rule something out in the field. Pinning `uring` on a machine that has
//! no `io_uring` is a *failure to start*, not a silent fallback, because the
//! whole point of pinning is to find out.
//!
//! `cleanup-deadline` arrives here from `nikaia.toml`, where Part III 13.3 had
//! put it. How long a program waits at exit for pending cleanup
//! ([ADR-006](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-006.md) D5) is an
//! operating property.
