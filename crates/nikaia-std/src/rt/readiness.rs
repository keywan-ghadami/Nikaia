//! **One poller, a registration each, and no worker in between**
//! ([ADR-038](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D3's readiness
//! half, as [ADR-194](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-194.md) D1's socket
//! needs it).
//!
//! ## What this replaces, and why it is not about speed
//!
//! A readiness wait used to be an [`super::worker::Op`]: the descriptor was
//! duplicated, handed to an I/O worker over a channel, and the worker **blocked
//! in `poll_one` for the whole of the wait**. `io-workers` is `1` by default
//! ([ADR-038](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D4 — *one I/O
//! thread always runs*), so a wait that had not answered blocked every other
//! wait in the process. A server waiting on `accept` while a connection waited
//! on `read` was a server that stalled, and that is the shape an HTTP server
//! has.
//!
//! Measured on the way in, and the numbers chose this shape
//! ([ADR-009](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-009.md) D4):
//!
//! | | per wait |
//! | :--- | ---: |
//! | a poller built per wait, which is what the worker did | 7.4 µs |
//! | one poller, `add` and `delete` around each wait | 2.5 µs |
//! | a registration kept and re-armed | 1.2 µs |
//! | **the whole round trip through a worker** | **35 µs** |
//!
//! So the poller was never the cost: **28 of the 35 µs was the hop**, and the
//! occupancy was not a cost at all but a ceiling.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! One [`polling::Poller`] for the process and one thread inside its `wait`.
//! Arming is an `epoll_ctl` on the **calling** thread — it does not block, so
//! there is nothing to hand to anybody. When the kernel answers, the thread
//! fills the slot, wakes the waker, and rings the bell
//! ([ADR-121](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-121.md) D1), because a
//! parked executor is asleep in the ring or on the condvar and a `Waker` alone
//! does not reach either.
