//! The I/O threads, and the boundary that keeps user code off them.
//!
//! [ADR-038](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D4 starts one of
//! these before the first statement the user wrote, so that an operation costs
//! no thread wake-up. [ADR-037](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md)
//! D2 says whose thread it is: *the compiler's*, not the user's - which is the
//! only reason it may exist at `user_parallelism = no` at all.
//!
//! ## Where that boundary is, in the code
//!
//! It is [`Op`]. A worker's inbox is a channel of `Op`, `Op` is a **closed
//! enum private to `crate::rt`**, and no variant of it carries a closure, a
//! `Box<dyn FnOnce>` or anything else a program could put its own code into.
//! So "nothing the user wrote runs on the I/O thread" is not a convention that
//! review has to keep: outside this module there is no way to name a value the
//! channel accepts.
//!
//! The other direction is checked at run time, cheaply: [`on_io_worker`] is
//! true only inside a worker's loop, and every public entry point of
//! [`crate::rt::io`] asserts it is false. A `std` function that ended up being
//! called from a worker would be a `std` bug, and it says so rather than
//! deadlocking.
