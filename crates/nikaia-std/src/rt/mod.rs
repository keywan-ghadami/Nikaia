//! `std`'s runtime: started before `main`, and the one surface I/O goes
//! through.
//!
//! This module is
//! [ADR-038](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D3, D4 and D5, and
//! it is deliberately *here* rather than in the compiler. ADR-033 §8.4 gave
//! the reason when it put the statement overlap behind
//! [`crate::task::both`]: the next change of mechanism must be a `std` change
//! and not a compiler change. Nothing about `io_uring`, `epoll`, a thread
//! count or a configuration key appears in a `.nika` file or in the emitted
//! Rust - a program says `fs::read_to_string(p)` and what happens underneath
//! is this file's business (Part I 8.1, Part III 15.x).
//!
//! ## D4 — it is running before the first statement the user wrote
//!
//! An I/O thread that is already running costs nothing per operation; one
//! started per pair of operations costs a wake-up per pair, which is the whole
//! of ADR-033 §8.4's finding. So the emitted `fn main` starts this and then
//! calls the program:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! fn main() {
//!     let runtime = nikaia_std::rt::start(nikaia_std::rt::UserCode::Sequential);
//!     let outcome = nikaia_main();
//!     runtime.finish();
//!     outcome
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! What starts is what [ADR-037](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md)
//! D2 allows. At `user_parallelism = no`: the I/O workers, and everything the
//! user wrote on the main thread. At `yes`: a pool for user code as well. The
//! asymmetry is D2's own - the compiler's threads were never bounded by that
//! switch, and the I/O thread is one of the compiler's ([ADR-016](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-016.md) D3).
//!
//! ## D3 — the two halves of I/O, behind one surface
//!
//! * **Files complete.** [`uring`] hands the read to the kernel and collects
//!   it; no thread performs it and none is woken for it.
//! * **Sockets signal readiness.** [`worker`]'s poller says when a descriptor
//!   can be read or written without blocking, and the caller does the transfer.
//! * **The fallback is the blocking path on an I/O worker**, for the machine
//!   that has no completion queue: an older kernel, a sandbox that forbids the
//!   syscalls, a target that never had them.
//!
//! **Which one is chosen is decided when the program starts, never when it is
//! compiled.** A binary built on a machine with `io_uring` runs on one without
//! it. The only compile-time gate is on `io_uring`'s *bindings*, which do not
//! exist off Linux at all; on Linux the choice is [`Method::Auto`] probing the
//! kernel, or an operator pinning it (D5).
