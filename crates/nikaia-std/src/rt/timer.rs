//! When the executor should look again, where what it is waiting for is a time.
//!
//! **Every other `Pending` in this runtime is waiting for a completion**, and
//! the park is how the thread waits for one. A `sleep`
//! ([ADR-150](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-150.md)) is waiting for
//! nothing at all — the clock is not something a worker posts — so the park
//! would answer *there is nothing outstanding* and the executor would spin or
//! call it a defect.
//!
//! So a sleeping future leaves the time it wants here, and the park takes the
//! nearest of them as its bound. One cell and not a queue: what the executor
//! needs is the **earliest**, every pending future is polled once a round, and
//! a future that is still pending leaves its time here again — so the cell is
//! rebuilt each round rather than kept in step with a set of registrations
//! nobody would remove from.
