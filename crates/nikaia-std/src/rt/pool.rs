//! The `yes` executor: a task may run on a thread of its own
//! ([ADR-055](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-055.md) §6 step 1's second
//! half, [ADR-037](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D2).
//!
//! **A second executor and not a use of the pool that was already there.**
//! `rayon`'s pool is a work-stealing pool for **closures**: `join` and
//! `par_iter` hand it a `FnOnce`, it runs it to the end, and there is no point
//! at which a closure gives its thread up. A task can pause, so what a pool
//! would have to hold for one is a future to be polled again later, which is
//! not what a closure pool is for. So this is a queue of futures over the same
//! worker count (`user-pool`), and `rayon` keeps the work it is good at:
//! `fs::map`'s UTF-8 check and the parallel piece driver.
//!
//! **What is different from [`super::exec`]'s one thread** is all one
//! difference — a task may be polled on a thread that did not start it — and
//! three things follow from it:
//!
//! * a task's future must be `Send` (§2 D6), which the compiler refuses before
//!   this can;
//! * a waker has to reach the queue from any thread, so a task is an
//!   `Arc<Cell>` a waker pushes back rather than a flag one loop reads;
//! * and **exactly one thread at a time may wait in the I/O**, because the ring
//!   is behind a lock and a thread inside `io_uring_enter` is woken by the
//!   kernel and by nothing else. That thread is the **pilot**; every other
//!   worker waits on this pool's own bell.
