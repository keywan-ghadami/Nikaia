//! The executor: what drives a Nikaia program that can pause
//! ([ADR-055](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-055.md) D3).
//!
//! **Why this is ours and not a bound runtime.**
//! [ADR-038](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D3 built the I/O —
//! completion for files, readiness for everything else — and D4 starts it before
//! the program's first statement. A `tokio` or a `smol` brings an executor *and*
//! an I/O layer, so binding one would put two event loops in one process, which
//! is the hazard D7 treats when a foreign crate causes it. What was missing is
//! the smaller half: a task queue and a waker. That is this file.
//!
//! **What a suspension point becomes.** Before this, a Nikaia function that
//! paused did it by blocking its thread, and Part II 11.2's *"at `no` the task is
//! interleaved on the same thread"* was unbuildable — two synchronous closures
//! cannot interleave, because neither yields. Here a pause is a `Poll::Pending`,
//! and the executor runs something else.
//!
//! **One thread, deliberately.** This is `user_parallelism = no`, which is the
//! default ([ADR-037](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D2), and at
//! that setting *nothing the user wrote ever runs concurrently* — interleaved is
//! not concurrent. The `yes` executor is the next step and is not here.
