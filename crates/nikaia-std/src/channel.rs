//! Message passing: a **bounded** queue between a sender and a receiver
//! ([ADR-149](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-149.md), Part II 12.5).
//!
//! **Nothing here is a language construct.** Two values and two methods say
//! everything the page's example says, and the tuple `let` that binds them was
//! already built ([ADR-098](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-098.md)).
//!
//! **And there is no `unbounded()`** (D5). A capacity is a promise about
//! memory, and this language makes programs say their promises; an unbounded
//! channel is a memory leak with a name and a `send` that never pauses, which
//! is the one thing a program cannot reason about under load. A program that
//! wants *unbounded* writes a large number — and has said it.
