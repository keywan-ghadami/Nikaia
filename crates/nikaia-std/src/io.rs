//! `std::io` - standard input.
//!
//! Part III 17.1 and [ADR-019](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-019.md). A
//! stream is not a file, and the surface says so: no map, no seek, no length,
//! and no second read of the same bytes. `std::fs`'s zero-copy story rests on
//! pages that exist before the program asks for them; stdin's bytes do not
//! exist until they are read, so a program that wants views into its input owns
//! the buffer first.
//!
//! Neither function is `sync`: a read from a pipe is a suspension point, which
//! is exactly what the `sync` rule (Part II, 12.1) exists to keep out of a
//! `par_iter` body.
//!
//! **Whole-of-input reads suspend; a line at a time does not yet**
//! ([ADR-121](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-121.md) D4).
//!
//! Since [ADR-055](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-055.md) §6 step 3 these
//! signatures have said a read from here may pause, which is what a caller's
//! compiler reads and what makes the enclosing function `async`. The bodies did
//! not: the blocking read ran on the program's own thread, because a worker's
//! reply could not wake an executor parked on the ring and a future fed from one
//! had nowhere to come back to.
//!
//! ADR-121 D1 put the bell on the ring, so [`read`] and [`read_to_string`] are
//! now the read they always were, performed on an I/O worker and **awaited**.
//! There is still no second read shape and no ring path for a stream with no
//! size to `stat`, which is D4's own sentence: what changed is the park.
//!
//! **And [`lines`] has moved too**
//! ([ADR-172](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-172.md) D4), which took a
//! decision about the *language* rather than a change to the runtime. A step of
//! it was an `Iterator::next`, and a suspension point inside one is
//! `while let Some(x) = s.next().await` below - so D1 decided that a `for` may
//! iterate something whose step pauses and writes that form, and [`Lines`] has
//! an inherent `async fn next` for it to write. The chunking is what keeps it
//! from costing more than it saves: a hop to a worker per *line* would be
//! slower than the blocking reader, so a buffer comes back at a time.

/// What a `std` call fails with ([ADR-158](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-158.md) D1).
///
/// Part I 7.1's error type, for the library: an `enum` with payload, `impl
/// Error`, and variants a `catch` can tell apart. Until this existed every
/// `std` entry wrote `throws = ["?"]` — *something this compiler cannot name* —
/// which is the absence of an answer standing in for one, and it made
/// [ADR-023](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-023.md) D1's set unusable for
/// every program that reads a file.
///
/// **It lives in `io` and is written out.** `use std::io` and
/// `io::IoError::NotFound(…)` is what a program that matches on it writes, which
/// is [ADR-154](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-154.md) D3's rule applied
/// straight: what needs no prefix is Part I 1.3's list, and this is not on it.
/// `fs::read` throwing an `io` type is the cost, accepted: a program that only
/// *propagates* the failure names nothing, and one that takes it apart writes
/// the second `use`.
///
/// **Why these four.** D4 of [ADR-023](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-023.md)
/// makes the variants of one error type **closed**, so each is a lasting
/// commitment and the list is short on purpose:
///
/// * `NotFound` is the specification's own — Appendix A.1 calls *a missing
///   file* the example of a recoverable error, and D6's worked output writes
///   `IoError::NotFound`;
/// * `PermissionDenied` is the other environmental failure a program acts on
///   **differently** rather than reports;
/// * `NotText` is `std`'s own rather than the operating system's: three places
///   here check UTF-8 and report `InvalidData`, and Part III 17.1 specifies the
///   check;
/// * `Other` is D4's **named residue** — *exhaustiveness degrades to "and
///   anything else"* — carrying what the operating system said.
///
/// **The payload is owned text and not a view.**
/// [ADR-023](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-023.md) D10 says a path that
/// came from a buffer should travel as a view; that is the tether
/// ([ADR-008](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-008.md)), which is not built,
