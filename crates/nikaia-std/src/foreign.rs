//! What a C library hands back that this language has to copy

//!
//! `getenv` hands back a C string: memory the caller does not own, whose
//! lifetime is the library's, and which ends at a zero byte rather than
//! carrying a length. None of those three is something a `String` can be made
//! of without reading it, so the reading is here — **one function, written
//! once**, where every program would otherwise write the same loop inside its
//! own `unsafe` block.
//!
//! **The handle is opaque and has no `cleanup`**, which is what tells it from
//! [ADR-147](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-147.md) D3's: a `FILE` is ours
//! to close and a C string is not ours at all. Nothing here frees anything.
