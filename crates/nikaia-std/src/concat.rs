// `a + b` where one side is text.
//
// **Rust's own rule reached the user unchanged**, and only one of the four
// shapes a program can write compiled:
//
// ```text
// "a" + "b"  →  error[E0369]: cannot add `&str` to `&str`
// "a" + s    →  error[E0369]: cannot add `String` to `&str`
// s + "b"    →  compiles
// s + s2     →  error[E0308]: mismatched types
// ```
//
// — about a file nobody wrote, which is Part III C.1's class. This language's
// `+` says nothing about which side is owned and should not have to.
//
// **A trait, and the reason is the one `index::At` gives.** This emitter does
// not know types (ADR-011 D2), so it writes one call and the language below
// picks. What that buys here is not merely *working*: it is that each shape
// keeps the lowering that suits it. Measured over three million
// concatenations, best of three — `String + &str` as it lowers today, 42 ms;
// `format!("{}{}")` for every shape, 250 ms; through this trait, **42 ms**. So
// the rule *is* the table of four cases rather than a replacement for it, and
// the obvious single rule would have been a sixfold regression on the one form
// that already worked.
//
// **Only text comes through here**, and that is a hard line rather than a
// scope choice. A number's `+` may not leave this language's own crates:
// [ADR-043] D1 turns `overflow-checks` on **per Nikaia crate** while the
// profile turns them off, because a foreign crate's hash function wraps on
// purpose — and this crate is on the foreign side of that split. Measured with
// the same profile shape: `a + b` in a checked crate aborts, and the same
// `a + b` through an `#[inline]` helper in an unchecked one wraps silently to
// `-9223372036854775808`. Inlining does not carry the check across; it is
// decided where the code is **written**. So the checker says which `+` is a
// concatenation and every other one stays exactly where it is
// ([ADR-081](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-081.md) D2).
//
// [ADR-043]: ../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-043.md
