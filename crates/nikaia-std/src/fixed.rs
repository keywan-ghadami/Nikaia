//! A map whose keys the build knew
//! ([ADR-176](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-176.md) D2,
//! [ADR-079](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-079.md) D3).
//!
//! **Four tables and no generated code.** The obvious lowering for a small map
//! was a `match` written out by the emitter, because that is what the numbers
//! favour against a hash. What [`docs/history/fixed-map-lookup.md`](../../../docs/history/fixed-map-lookup.md)
//! §6 then measured is a **linear scan over these very arrays**, and it is the
//! `match` within 0 to 17 % up to twenty-four keys — a dozen past the point
//! where the perfect hash has already taken the lead. So the range where a
//! `match` would be worth generating is empty, and what a `comptime` crosses as
//! is a value rather than a function.
//!
//! Which buys three things. A `Fixed` is a **value** a program may pass and
//! store. The emitter stays one that knows no types
//! ([ADR-011](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-011.md) D2), because there is
//! nothing to write but a `const`. And the threshold lives in the data — a
//! table with no displacements is a small one — rather than as a branch in the
//! compiler.
