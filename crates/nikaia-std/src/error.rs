//! Kap 7.1: what an error carries besides its message.
//!
//! An error raised by `throw` arrives here on its way into the failure channel.
//! What this module adds is the part the author did not write and should not
//! have to: where it was raised, what joined it on the way, and — only where a
//! program asked for it — a stack trace.
//!
//! **Why the trace is not simply always there.** Capturing one costs about
//! 28 300 instructions per error - roughly sixteen times what the rest of the
//! program does - for a value almost nothing reads. So it is off unless
//! `NIKAIA_TRACE` asks for it. The measurement behind that number, and the
//! reasoning that made it the deciding one, are ADR-023 §3.2.
//!
//! **`NIKAIA_TRACE` is the only switch.** `Backtrace::capture()` consults
//! `RUST_BACKTRACE`/`RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE` and is `Disabled` unless one of them
//! is set, so a program told to trace would silently not have traced. This
//! module uses `force_capture` behind its own flag: one variable decides, and
//! it is the one the message names.
