//! Converting a floating-point number to an integer, checked.
//!
//! [ADR-043](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-043.md) D4 and D7. A narrowing
//! conversion aborts, and between two integers Rust gives the check:
//! `i32::try_from` hands back a failure value. Out of a floating-point number it
//! does not — `the trait bound i32: TryFrom<f64> is not satisfied` — so the test
//! lives here.
//!
//! **What Rust's `as` does instead, measured.** It is silent in three different
//! ways: `1e20 as i32` is `2147483647`, `-1e20 as i32` is `-2147483648`, and
//! `f64::NAN as i32` is `0`. A program that meant any of those said nothing about
//! it, which is what this removes.
//!
//! These are the one place ADR-043 puts a helper in the emitted code, and D4 says
//! why the objection that refused one for arithmetic does not reach here: a
//! conversion is rare and written down on purpose rather than standing in every
//! loop, and a checked conversion is what a Rust programmer would write at this
//! spot anyway.

/// T::MAX as f64` — is wrong for every 64-bit target, because `i64::MAX as f64`
/// rounds **up**: it accepts a value one past what the type holds and then lets
/// `as` clamp it. Written against the target's limits it needs a hand-computed
/// power of two per type, and for a type whose width the machine decides
/// (D7's second neighbour) the constant would have to differ per machine.
///
/// Through `i128` there is nothing to compute. `f64 as i128` saturates at
/// ±2^127, which is outside every integer type this can target, so a saturated
/// value cannot land back inside the target's range and be let through - and
/// `try_from` then answers exactly, at whatever width the machine gives the type.
///
/// **"Not a number" is asked first**, because it is the one case the range test
/// cannot catch: `f64::NAN as i128` is `0`, which fits everything.
///
/// `.trunc()` is what `as` means - toward zero, not toward the nearest.
