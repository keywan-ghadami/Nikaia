//! [ADR-196](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-196.md) D1 decided.
//!
//! `src/tools/rust.nika` is the source; `src/tools/rust.rs` beside it is what
//! `nikaia lower-std` made of it and what this links against. There is no
//! process here and no C ABI: `nikaia_std::tools::rust::file` is a function call, and
//! what comes back is `Vec<Item>` with `&str` views into the text that was
//! handed in.
//!
//! What is asserted is mostly what is **not** found. The hand-written character
//! scanner this replaces (`crates/nikaia/src/describe.rs`) reports four
//! functions that do not exist on the fixture below, and this is where that
//! stops being true.
