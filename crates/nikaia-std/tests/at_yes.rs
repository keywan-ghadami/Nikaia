//! process** ([ADR-038](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D4): the
//! first thing to ask for it decides what it is, and a unit test that ran after
//! one asking for `Sequential` would find no pool and quietly measure the
//! single-threaded executor instead. What is asserted here is a wall-clock
//! difference, so a silent fallback would read as a failure of the pool rather
//! than of the setup.

/// **The shape a generated `main` has at `user_parallelism = yes`**, end to
/// end: the runtime is started as `Concurrent`, `block_on` drives `main` on
/// this thread, and the tasks are on the pool
/// ([ADR-055](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-055.md) §6 step 1's `yes`
/// half).
///
/// Four tasks that each hold a core for a slice finish in about one slice
/// rather than four. And `main` is *joining* them, so it is parked while they
/// run — which is the piece the one-thread executor never needed: at `no`
/// nothing else can fill a slot while `main` is parked, and here everything
/// does.
