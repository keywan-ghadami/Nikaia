// crates/nikaia/src/foreign.rs
//
// A crate is described before it is called - `NK2504`
// ([ADR-104](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-104.md) D1).
//
// ## What this is for
//
// A call into a Rust crate no ledger describes was **silent**. Every analysis
// this compiler has - what may cross a thread, what a call may reach, whether it
// pauses, whether it can fail - reads a contract at the boundary, and where
// there is none they all read the same thing: nothing. Fail-closed answers stop
// a few of the questions (`crosses_into_an_unseen_call` hands the crossing on
// rather than accepting it), and the rest simply do not happen.
//
// D1 removes the third answer. There is a described crate and a refused call,
// and the message names the command that turns the second into the first.
//
// ## Which way it errs
//
// **Only where the build itself declared the crate.** The set comes from
// `[dependencies]` with `type = "rust"` (`manifest::foreign_crates`), so a
// qualified name this compiler cannot account for - a module of the program, a
// Nikaia package, a `std` path, a typo - is not this refusal's business and
// keeps whatever message it already had. Refusing on a name nobody declared
// would be [Part III C.4](../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)'s
// correct program refused, which is the worse of the two mistakes.
//
// **And once per crate, not once per call.** The reader's next move is one
// command for the whole crate, so four calls into `regex` are one thing to do
// and one message to read. The caret is on the first call, which is where they
// will start.
