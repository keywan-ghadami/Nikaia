//! A project build: `nikaia.toml` becomes a `Cargo.toml`, and `cargo` runs it.
//!
//! [ADR-002](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-002.md) D1. Dependency
//! resolution and linking are solved problems, and a language that cannot reach
//! crates.io starts with no ecosystem - so the toolchain does not resolve
//! versions, does not link, and does not own a build graph. It translates a
//! manifest, hands the result to Cargo, and intercepts the one step Cargo
//! cannot do: turning a `.nika` file into something `rustc` accepts.
//!
//! The interception is `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER`, and the choice of *that*
//! variable rather than `RUSTC_WRAPPER` is the load-bearing part. It is applied
//! to **workspace members only**, so a crate from crates.io is compiled by the
//! real `rustc` with nothing in between - which is what makes "native Rust
//! dependencies pass through unchanged" true of the compilation and not only of
//! the manifest.
//!
//! What is generic about all this lives in
//! [`orchestrator::project`] ([ADR-003](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-003.md)
//! D2): rendering a manifest, running `cargo`, splitting a `rustc` command
//! line. What is here is Nikaia's half - which file is the entry, which
//! switches were chosen, and what the lowering does.
