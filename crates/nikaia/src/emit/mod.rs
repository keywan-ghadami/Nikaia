// Stage 0 of the bootstrap compiler: Nikaia in, Rust out.
//
// The three things this file exists for are the three halves of the grammar
// protocol that the parser backend already implements and Nikaia could not yet
// reach (README, "Bootstrap Compiler"):
//
//   * `grammar Name { rule ... }`  ->  `grammar! { grammar Name { ... } }`
//   * `@frame(boundary: "\n")`     ->  `#[frame(boundary = "\n")]`
//   * `Name.rule(input)`            ->  the generated `par_fold` driver, with
//                                      the `Parallelism` the build asks for
//
// What it is *not* is a type checker. The lowering is syntactic: every action
// block, every `init`/`step`/`merge` and every function body is emitted as
// written. Where Nikaia and Rust disagree about what a name means - a `&mut
// self` method used as a monoid's merge, `std::fs` - the emitted program says
// so by not compiling, rather than this file guessing. That is deliberate:
// guessing a receiver would be a semantic decision made in a printer.
//
// It emits a [`SourceMap`] alongside the code, because a transpiler that only
// emits code can only be told about errors in a file nobody wrote (ADR-012).
