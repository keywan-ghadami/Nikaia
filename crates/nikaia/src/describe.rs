//
// `nikaia describe <crate>` — a draft ledger for a Rust crate's boundary
// ([ADR-104](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-104.md) D2, D3, D4).
//
// ## What it is for
//
// D1 refuses a call into a crate nothing describes and names this command. What
// the command writes is `contracts/<crate>.contracts`, the file every analysis
// then reads at that boundary — the crossing verdict, `keeps`, `sync` and
// `throws` stop failing closed on a call whose signature answers plainly.
//
// ## What it reads, and what it cannot
//
// **The crate's sources**, because D4's better half is not available: rustdoc's
// JSON is unstable, and [ADR-001](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-001.md) D1
// does not give up a stable-only toolchain for it.
//
// **They are read by a grammar written in Nikaia**
// ([ADR-195](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-195.md) D3):
// `crates/nikaia-std/src/tools/rust.nika`, lowered ahead of time and reached
// from here as an ordinary Rust module — `nikaia_std::tools::rust`, a call and
// nothing else ([ADR-196](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-196.md) D1). What
// stood here before was a hand-written character scanner that matched `pub fn`
// at the start of a line and counted braces without knowing what a brace is;
// on one crate it wrote entries for **four functions that do not exist**
// (`crates/nikaia/tests/describing.rs`).
//
// What is left that it cannot do:
//
//   * an item a **macro** generates is not in the text and is not found. That
//     limit is [ADR-001](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-001.md) D1's and not
//     the parser's: it survives `syn` too, for the reason rustdoc's JSON is out
//     of reach;
//   * a signature this cannot translate is written `?`, which is the absence of
//     a claim and never a guess (D4's own sentence);
//   * a **method** is not described: what an `impl`'s `pub fn` is at a foreign
//     boundary is D4's own question and nothing here asks it. The parser reads
//     them; this does not write them down.
//   * a **macro** is still the only one. The `mod`-path limit is **closed**: a
//     module is a block or a file, `src/foo/bar.rs` is `foo::bar`, and whether
//     a caller may write it is read from the `pub mod foo;` in its parent. A
//     module nothing declares is **not** offered, which is fail-closed and
//     [ADR-010](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-010.md) D1's polarity — the
//     absence is *nobody said this is public*.
//
// Each of those is D5's case: the draft is **committed and reviewed like code**,
// and a `?` in it is a person's to fill. A describer that guessed would put a
// claim in a file nobody wrote, which is the one thing a boundary description
// may not do.
//
// **And the direction that matters more than dropping what is not there**: a
// `pub use` is read, and what it carries out of a private `mod` is offered
// under the name it gives. Refusing a call a crate really answers is
// [Part III C.4](../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md), and the
// scanner refused every one of them.
//
// ## Which way it errs
//
// Fail-closed, everywhere the signature is silent: no `touches` (which reads as
// *touches everything*), no `locks` (that column's third answer), and no
// `crosses` (the absence is *nobody said*, never *it may not*). A Rust
// signature cannot tell anybody any of the three, and reading silence as
// "nothing" is the polarity [ADR-010](../../docs/specification/adr/adr-010.md)
// D1 forbids.
