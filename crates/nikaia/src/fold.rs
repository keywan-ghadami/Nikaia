//! What a constant integer expression comes to, for the two passes that ask.
//!
//! The arithmetic used to live in the checker, where it answers *"does this fit
//! the type beside it?"* ([`check`](crate::check)'s `NK1116` and `NK1118`). The
//! emitter now asks a second question of the same expression - *"is the first
//! type that holds this an `i64`?"*
//! ([ADR-063](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-063.md)) - and two constant
//! folds in one compiler is one fold and one liability.
//!
//! **What separates the two callers is not the arithmetic, it is the lookup.**
//! The checker knows what a name is worth; the emitter has no scope and no
//! types ([ADR-028](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-028.md)). So the lookup
//! is the parameter, and the emitter passes [`nothing_is_known`] - which gives
//! it exactly the subset of expressions that can be answered without looking
//! anything up.
//!
//! **Folded in an `i128`**, so a sum that cannot fit an `i64` is a number the
//! caller can name rather than one this wrapped: the fold must not do quietly
//! what it exists to report.
//!
//! **Every step is `checked_`, and `None` means nothing is claimed.** A name the
//! lookup cannot evaluate, an operator this does not fold, a division by a
//! constant zero, a fold that leaves the `i128` - each one stops the whole
//! expression. An expression that does not fold is never refused, which is the
//! polarity both callers are held to (Part III, C.4): the compiler may fail to
//! refuse a program `rustc` will, and may never refuse one that is right.
