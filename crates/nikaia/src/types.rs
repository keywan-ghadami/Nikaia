// A *value* nothing declares has had `NK1117` since
// [ADR-051](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-051.md) — *"nothing declares
// `q`"*. A type had nothing, so `let x: Widgit = 3` lowered verbatim and came
// back as `rustc`'s *"cannot find type `Widgit` in this scope"*, about a file
// nobody wrote. Part III C.1's rule held for one half of this language's names
// and not the other.
//
// **A walk of its own**, beside `dsl::check`, `views::check` and
// `traits::check`, and for the reason each of those is separate: it asks a
// question about a *written name* rather than about a value's type, so it needs
// the item tree and neither the scope stack nor the inference.
