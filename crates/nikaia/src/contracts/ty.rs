//
// The type language the checker reasons in, and the one the ledger records.
//
// It is `ast::Type` with one addition and one subtraction. The addition is
// `Unknown`, which is not a type but the absence of a claim - see below. The
// subtraction is the interner: a ledger is a file, so a name here is text, and
// two types are the same when they are written the same. That is name-for-name
// (ADR-011 D2) applied to types: nothing resolves a module or an alias, so
// `postgres::Connection` and `Connection` are different types, which is correct
// for a compiler that does not know they are not.
//
// **`Unknown` is the whole design.** Stage 0 has no signatures for the Rust
// half of `std` beyond what `std.contracts` writes down, and a Nikaia program
// calls `push_str`, `entry`, `map_or` and `chars` freely. A checker that had to
// answer for those would either need a second frontend for Rust or would have
// to guess - and a type checker that guesses reports errors that are not there,
// which is worse than one that says less. So the rule is:
//
//   * anything involving `Unknown` is compatible with anything;
//   * an error is reported only where **both** sides are known and disagree.
//
// The checker is therefore sound in the direction that matters for a tool
// people run: it never rejects a correct program. It does not catch every
// wrong one, and what it does not catch is a function of how much of `std` is
// written down - which is a number that goes up as ADR-014 proceeds, without
// this file changing.
