//
// Which of Part I 6.6's three states each view in a signature is in
// ([ADR-008](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-008.md) D2, D7).
//
// ## What this is, and what it deliberately is not
//
// D2 gives every view one of three states and says the compiler picks the least
// one that makes the program valid:
//
//     Borrowed ⊑ Tethered ⊑ Owned
//     Transient = borrow. Escaping = tether. Copying = yours to ask for.
//
// **Only the first of those is built as a representation.** Borrowed is the
// language below's own lifetime and costs nothing; Owned is `.to_owned()`,
// written by the program; and **Tethered is not built at all** — where a value
// would tether, the program is refused today (`NK2302`, or the backend on the
// Nikaia line for a view of a local that escapes). So this file computes the
// state and **changes no lowering**. It writes a column, which is D7, and the
// column is what a later change reads when the representation exists.
//
// That order is deliberate: an analysis whose answers nothing depends on can be
// held against the whole corpus and read, and being wrong costs a wrong line in
// a file rather than a wrong program.
//
// ## Owned is never this file's word
//
// D5: *promotion to `Owned` is never automatic*. A `.to_owned()` hands back a
// `String`, which is not a view at all — so no **view** position is ever Owned,
// and the lattice this file solves over is the two states below it. The top of
// the lattice exists for the program to reach, not for the analysis to assign.
//
// ## Which way it errs
//
// **Towards Tethered**, which is D7's own polarity for the case it names: a
// state barrier *widens* to Tethered, *"the widest representation, never to
// Owned"*. A position this file cannot decide is therefore Tethered, and the
// cost of being wrong that way is a representation wider than it had to be —
// never a program that does the wrong thing. The other direction would tell a
// later reader that a value borrows when it escapes, which is the use-after-free
// the state exists to prevent.
//
// ## What is not here, and why
//
// **D7's state barrier is not applied.** *Crossing a `dyn` boundary or a
// published non-generic API is a state barrier* is a consequence of there being
// three representations and one ABI to choose; with one representation there is
// no barrier to cross. It belongs with the layouts rather than with the
// analysis, and marking every `pub` signature Tethered today would fill the
// column with a state nothing has.
//
// **The buffer table is not here either** (D4). Its shape is a fact about a
// container's representation, and this file writes no representation.
