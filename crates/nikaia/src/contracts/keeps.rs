// Which parameters a body **keeps** ([ADR-094](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-094.md) D2).
//
// The question the caller is asked today and should not be: `page(entries)` or
// `page(&entries)`. Whether an argument is lent or handed over is a fact about
// the *callee's body*, and the caller repeating it is 42 `&` in 913 non-comment
// lines of `examples/` saying what the signature had already said — plus a
// `rustc` error about a moved value wherever one is left out.
//
// *Keeps* means the value outlives the call: stored into a struct, assigned
// into a place, handed back by value, given to a task, or passed to a callee
// whose own parameter keeps it. Everything else is a read, and a read can be
// lent.
//
// **Fail closed, and here that means *keeps*.** A use this walk cannot account
// for counts as keeping, because the two wrong answers are not symmetric.
// Saying *kept* of a value that is only read costs a caller an owned argument —
// which is where every caller already is, so it costs nothing anybody has. Saying
// *lent* of a value the body stores emits a `&T` parameter whose body moves it,
// and that is `rustc`'s error about a file nobody wrote (Part III C.1). Same
// polarity as `sync` ([ADR-027](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-027.md)) and
// as [ADR-010](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-010.md) D1, pointing the
// other way because the claim points the other way.
//
// **Nothing reads this column yet**, which is ADR-094 §5's first step on
// purpose: the answer can be diffed against the corpus before one call site
// changes.
