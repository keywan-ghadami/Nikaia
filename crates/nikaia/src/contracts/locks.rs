//
// Whether a function **touches a lock** ([ADR-039](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md)
// D3), propagated over the same call graph `sync` uses and with the opposite
// lattice.
//
// ## One traversal and two lattices
//
// | | starts from | rule |
// | :--- | :--- | :--- |
// | `sync` | everyone is `sync` | **greatest** fixpoint — take the claim from whoever reaches a non-holder |
// | this | nobody touches one | **least** fixpoint — give the property to whoever reaches a holder |
//
// So mutual recursion between pure functions keeps `sync`
// ([ADR-027](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-027.md) D1) and correctly
// gets nothing here, for the mirrored reason — the same shape `keeps` has
// beside it, and for the same reason: a restriction is added on doubt where a
// promise is taken away on doubt.
//
// ## What a base case is, and why the checker answers it
//
// A **door** is `get`, `set`, `access` or `update` on a `Locked` or a
// `SharedMut`, and `access_all` or `update_all` over several
// ([ADR-039](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) D10,
// [ADR-065](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-065.md)). Which of those a
// call goes to is a question about the **receiver's type**, and this file has
// none: `kasse.set(42)` names `set`, and so does a `Config::set` somebody
// wrote. So the base case is read from `check::MethodCalls::resolved`, which is
// the type checker's answer ([ADR-028](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-028.md))
// — the same arrangement `keeps` uses for its receivers, and for the same
// reason.
//
// **Guessing by name would make the column worthless rather than merely
// coarse.** `set` and `get` are among the most common method names a program
// writes; a column that answered *touches a lock* for every one of them would
// be set almost everywhere, and a refusal reading it would refuse correct
// programs — which is the one thing Part III C.4 forbids.
//
// ## Fail-closed, and what that costs here
//
// An **unresolvable** call sets the property, which is D3's own sentence: it
// takes the `sync` claim away *and* sets this, so one polarity decision serves
// both. That is the safe direction for a refusal about deadlock — the wrong
// answer the other way is a program that hangs.
//
// **It is also why nothing reads this column yet.** The measurement comes
// first: a property that lands on most of the corpus is one whose refusals
// would be noise, and that is a thing to find out before `NK2201` and `NK2203`
// are written against it, not after.
//
// ## A scope's tasks count and a `spawn` does not
//
// A scope waits for its tasks, so they run **during** the call and their bodies
// belong to the surrounding function — the same reason a trailing lambda's body
// does ([ADR-029](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-029.md) D4). A task
// started with `spawn` runs later and elsewhere, so taking a lock in one is the
// ordinary case and its body is not walked.
