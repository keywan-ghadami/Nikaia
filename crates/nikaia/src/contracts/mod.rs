// The Borrow Contract Ledger (Part III, 13.5; ADR-005 D3; ADR-020).
//
// What a caller has to know about a function it cannot see the body of: does it
// pause, can it fail, and does what it hands back point into what it was given.
// Part III 13.5 specifies a file that records exactly that, derived rather than
// written, committed like a lockfile, and **shipped with a published package**
// so that a consumer builds against contracts instead of guesses.
//
// This is that file, for what Stage 0 knows, and the three answers come from
// three different places.
//
// `throws` is *declared* in the source and recorded exactly. The borrow
// contract is *inferred from the signature* - the widest one a signature can
// support - rather than by the whole-program analysis ADR-005 D3 describes.
// `sync` is *inferred from the body* (ADR-027): a function that provably cannot
// pause gets the promise whether or not anyone wrote the word, and where the
// word is written it stays an assertion for `NK2202` to check. `sharing` is
// inferred from the bodies too (ADR-037 D7), and it is the one column that can
// only ever get *better*: its floor is the safe answer, so a ledger that says
// nothing about a `Shared` still describes a correct program.
//
// That is why the header names the inference that produced the ledger. A later
// compiler that infers more will write a different name there, and `--locked`
// will say so rather than quietly accepting the weaker answer.
