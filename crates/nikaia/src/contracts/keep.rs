// crates/nikaia/src/contracts/keep.rs
//
// Where a buffer lives once views of it outlive the scope that made it
// ([ADR-209](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-209.md), Part I 6.6).
//
// ## The question, and the one answer to it
//
// A body reads a file into `text`, cuts it into views, and something keeps the
// views longer than `text` would live: the result, a `mut` parameter, a list
// declared outside the loop, a task. [ADR-008](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-008.md)
// calls that value **tethered** and says the buffer has to live as long as the
// views do. This file decides **where** it lives, and the answer is always the
// same rule (D1):
//
// > **A buffer lives in the keep of whatever keeps its views.**
//
// What differs is who owns that keep, and that is read off facts this compiler
// already has rather than chosen once for every program (D2-D4):
//
// * **a frame** - the nearest caller, or this function's own frame for a list
//   declared outside the loop. Costs nothing: no count, no handle, and the body
//   may pause (D2);
// * **a handle that travels with the value**, where no frame outlives it - a
//   task (D3);
// * **a handle per element**, where a container keeps views across a loop and
//   drops entries as it goes - one keep for the loop would keep every buffer it
//   ever read (D4).
//
// ## How a view is followed
//
// By **origin**: every local carries the set of places its views may point
// into. A `let` whose initialiser makes a buffer (`makes_a_buffer`, the same
// question the column above asks) is an origin; so is a call to a function that
// itself hands back tethered views, because its buffer needs a keep from here.
// Origins flow through methods, fields, indexing, `for` bindings, struct and
// list literals, `push` and `insert`, and they stop at anything that hands back
// something of its own: `to_owned`, `len`, a call whose declared result holds no
// view. That last stop is the one `views::check` was missing, and why it blamed
// `path` for a view of the text `fs::read_to_string(path)` read.
//
// ## Which way it errs
//
// **Towards a keep, never towards a refusal.** A keep nobody needed costs a
// buffer living until the end of a scope instead of the end of a statement. A
// refusal nobody needed is a correct program refused
// ([Part III C.4](../../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)). So a
// destination whose type this walk cannot read is taken to hold a view, and a
// refusal is only ever raised where the type says so.
