// crates/nikaia/src/contracts/sync.rs
//
// Part II 12.1: a `sync` function may only call `sync` functions.
//
// Two analyses of one rule, running in **opposite directions**, and keeping
// them apart is the whole design (ADR-027).
//
// `check` verifies an assertion. Someone wrote `sync`, and this reports the
// calls that contradict it (`NK2202`). It is conservative in the **permissive**
// direction: with no receiver types, `a.method()` cannot be looked up, so it is
// not an error. What *can* be looked up is a call by name - a function in this
// unit, or a path like `io::read_to_string` into a library's ledger - and that
// is where the rule earns its keep, because `fs::` and `io::` are named rather
// than called on a receiver. The check never rejects a program the rule allows,
// and does not yet catch every program the rule forbids. An unchecked promise
// catches nothing at all, so that is worth having and worth saying.
//
// `infer` makes a claim, and therefore runs the other way. It writes `sync`
// into the ledger for a function nobody annotated, and that entry is **shipped**
// (Part III 13.5): a consumer reads it and puts the function inside `access`.
// So it is conservative in the **restrictive** direction - a call it cannot
// resolve is a call it cannot vouch for, and the function does not get the
// promise. The ledger settled this polarity once already, for provenance: "an
// analysis that fails open is a vulnerability generator". Inferring `sync` from
// a body full of calls one cannot see would be exactly that.
//
// **Why infer at all.** Before this, `sync` was opt-in, so almost nothing was
// `sync`, so `access`, `access_all`, `par_iter` and the panic hook - everything
// Part II 12.2 makes safe by demanding a `sync` lambda - could call almost
// nothing. The restrictive side of the language was the unusable one, and the
// way out was to annotate a chain of pure helpers by hand. Now a body that
// provably cannot pause says so on its own, and `sync` in the source becomes
// what `@borrowed` is in Part I 6.6: an **assertion you write where you want it
// held**, checked against the body, rather than a mode you have to enter.
