//! Kap 7.1: which errors can leave a function.
//!
//! `throws` in the source says *that* a function can fail. Which errors is a
//! question about its body and about everything its body reaches, so it is
//! derived here rather than written down — the argument of
//! [ADR-005](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-005.md) D3, applied to the
//! second kind of contract in
//! [ADR-023](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-023.md) D1.
//!
//! This is [`super::sync`]'s walk with the lattice turned around. `sync` is a
//! **greatest** fixpoint over a boolean: everyone starts pure and loses the
//! claim on contact with something that pauses. An error set is a **least**
//! fixpoint: everyone starts with what they throw themselves, and grows by what
//! their callees throw, until nothing changes. Mutual recursion terminates for
//! the same reason it does there — the sets only grow, and there are finitely
//! many names to grow by.
//!
//! The call resolution is `sync`'s, not a second one. ADR-028 recorded what the
//! alternative costs: two analyses that have to agree about what `stats.add(5)`
//! goes to, and eventually do not. That includes the **method** half of it: the
//! type checker resolves a receiver and both walks read its answer, so
//! `a.add(v)` in ADR-031's `HashMap[&str, Stats]` chain reaches `Stats::add`
//! here for the same reason it reaches it in [`super::sync`]. Before that this
//! file answered every method call with `"?"` - fail-closed and therefore not a
//! bug, but a set that said "something I cannot name" about a call the compiler
//! had already named.
