// crates/nikaia/src/contracts/trust.rs
//
// Where a program's bytes came from (ADR-010).
//
// `Trusted ⊑ Untrusted`, joined in the safe direction: one untrusted input
// makes the result untrusted. The sources are `std`'s, stated in its ledger
// (ADR-020) - a file the operator named, a pipe they connected, the arguments
// they typed - and a program's own trust is the join over the ones it calls.
//
// **One buffer, because Stage 0 has one input lifetime.** ADR-008's model gives
// a compilation unit a single lifetime, so it has a single input buffer: every
// view a parser cuts, every struct tied to it, and every key of a map keyed by
// a view point into the same thing. The join over a program's sources is
// therefore not a coarsening of a per-buffer analysis - it *is* the per-buffer
// analysis, for the one buffer this representation can express. When the
// representation grows more than one, this becomes the join over each.
//
// **A barrier widens to untrusted, never the other way** (ADR-010 D1). A call
// this compiler cannot resolve could be anything, so a program that reaches one
// whose result it then treats as input has no proof of who chose those bytes.
// What Stage 0 can reach is `std`, which states all of its sources, so today
// there is no such call - and `Reason::Unresolved` is what will carry it when
// there is.
