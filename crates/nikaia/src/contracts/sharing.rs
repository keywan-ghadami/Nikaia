// crates/nikaia/src/contracts/sharing.rs
//
// Which reference count a **particular** `Shared` value gets
// ([ADR-037](../../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D7).
//
// ## One rule, and everything here is downstream of it
//
//     It may only ever take an atomic away.
//
// ADR-037 D6 made the atomic count the **floor**, and ADR-061 D2 lowered that
// floor at `user_parallelism = no`, where nothing a user writes can cross and D1
// closed the last way out of the program. So the floor is the atomic count at
// `yes` and the plain one at `no`, and this file is an **optimisation** on top of
// whichever floor the build has and nothing else. What does *not* move with the
// switch is `contracts::send`'s verdict about the type, which is why a `Shared`
// permitted into a task at `no` is still sound: there the task is interleaved on
// the same thread and the crossing the verdict allows does not happen. It may lower a
// particular value to a plain count where it *proves* that nothing crosses a
// thread with it; where it cannot prove that, the answer stays atomic. It may
// never add an atomic, and it may never make a program unsafe - which are the
// same sentence read from both ends.
//
// **That is why being wrong here costs speed in one direction and correctness in
// the other**, and why the polarity is not negotiable. An atomic count where a
// plain one would have done costs about 9 ns per clone-and-drop pair
// (`docs/rc-or-arc.md` §3). A plain count on a value that crosses is a data
// race. So every case this cannot decide comes out [`Count::Atomic`], every such
// case carries the reason, and the reasons are a **closed list** - see
// [`Fallback`], which is the enumeration ADR-037 D8 answers "would an override
// help?" for.
//
// **Fail-closed is affordable here in places `NK25xx` could not afford it.**
// `send.rs` may not refuse what it cannot decide, because refusing a correct
// program is the one thing this compiler may never do (Part III C.4) - so it has
// a third answer, `Undecided`. This has two, because the cost of being wrong in
// the safe direction is speed: the program still compiles and still means the
// same thing. ADR-033 D4's polarity, applied where it is cheap.
//
// ## What this file promises `send.rs`
//
// `send.rs` answers `May` for a `Shared` of crossable data, and that answer is
// only true because the count is atomic. So the two files have a contract with
// each other, and it runs one way:
//
//     a value this file lowers to a plain count must not cross a thread.
//
// Every crossing is therefore a **seed**, and a missed seed is unsoundness
// rather than a missed optimisation. The seeds are ADR-005 §5.2's own
// enumeration of the crossings, asked per value rather than per type - including
// the one D6 made live. `task::both`, the crossing the *compiler* chooses for
// statement overlapping, used to be safe to leave out because a `Shared` was
// `MayNot` and was never overlapped; since D6 the result of an overlapped
// operation is a `Shared` that crosses back to the thread that started it, so it
// is a seed now, reached through [`Fallback::UnseenOrigin`] - a handle whose
// allocation this analysis did not watch being made.
//
// ## Why the fixpoint degenerates, which is itself a finding
//
// A count belongs to the **allocation**, not to the handle: two handles on one
// `Shared` share one count, so they cannot disagree about whether it is atomic.
// The relation between handles is therefore an *equivalence* and not an ordering,
// and the analysis is union-find over handles plus one colouring pass - a least
// fixpoint reached in a single step, where `sync` (ADR-027 D1) genuinely needs a
// greatest one because its constraint is conjunctive over a call graph that can
// cycle. The least fixpoint of "is atomic" is the complement of the greatest
// fixpoint of "stays plain", because every clause is a Horn clause and the only
// sources of `Atomic` are the seeds. What carries the weight is not the lattice -
// it is **which crossings are seeds**.
//
// ## What counts as an account, and the one thing it rests on
//
// A handle may stay plain only if every place it goes is a place something
// written down accounts for. Three kinds of place do:
//
//   * **a body this build lowers** - a function of this unit that is not
//     public. The handle joins the callee's parameter slot, one allocation gets
//     one answer, and whichever side of the call the crossing is on decides both;
//   * **a field of a type this unit declares**, through the ledger's `fields`
//     (ADR-024, the walk ADR-029 established) - run in the opposite direction
//     from `send.rs`: there a field that may not cross makes the struct refuse,
//     here a struct that crosses makes the field's count atomic;
//   * **a call the ledger describes**. This is the one that rests on something,
//     and it rests on exactly what ADR-005 §5.2 already rests on: a contract is
//     an account, `std`'s entries are written in the file that ships and
//     reviewed like code (ADR-005 §5.1), and a call nothing describes is the
//     crossing. The residual is the one §5.3 names - "enforceable only as far as
//     a foreign crate is honest". No `std` entry takes or hands back a **handle**
//     on a `Shared`: the one entry that mentions the type at all is
//     `Shared::deref`, which takes `&Shared[$T]` and hands back `&$T` - a borrow
//     duplicates nothing (ADR-040 D1) and what comes out is a view of the value
//     inside, so there is no handle for it to keep.
//     `a_std_entry_that_takes_a_shared_needs_a_second_look` in `tests/sharing.rs`
//     is what makes somebody look on the day one does take one.
//
// Everywhere else is [`Fallback`], and the remedy for every row of it is to
// write the contract down - ADR-033 D4's own closing argument, which is why
// ADR-037 D8 has no keyword in it.
