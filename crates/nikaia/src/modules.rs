// crates/nikaia/src/modules.rs
//
// A program is more than one file, and **a package is a directory**
// (Part I, 9.1; ADR-047 D1).
//
// The files of a package see one another with no `use` at all: they share one
// namespace, so a name declared in any of them can be written in any other. What
// the package offers outward is whatever says `pub`, in whichever file it is
// declared - which is what keeps a library's internal file layout from being its
// public surface.
//
// What this does is **resolution**, and resolution is the one thing ADR-011 D2
// said Stage 0 does not do: the lowering is name for name, and nothing looks a
// name up. That stays true of the *emitter* - what changes is that the compiler
// knows which files take part, and hands the emitter each of them in turn.
//
// The shape it produces is the plainest one the language below has: **one crate
// root**, with every file's items in it. No `mod`, no `use super::*`, nothing to
// resolve - because one namespace in this language is one namespace in that one.
// Two files declaring the same name is refused here rather than left to `rustc`,
// which would report it about a file nobody wrote (Part III, C.1).
//
// **Which files** is the directory and not the `use` lines. A `use` names another
// package (ADR-046 D1), and depending on one is not built (ADR-047 §5), so a
// `use` that is not `std`'s is refused with what to do instead.
