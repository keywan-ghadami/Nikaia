//
// The type checker.
//
// It answers one question per construct - "are these two types the same?" - and
// it answers it only where both sides are written down. That is the whole
// design, and `contracts::ty::Ty::Unknown` is what makes it honest: Stage 0 has
// no signatures for the Rust half of `std`, and a checker that guessed at
// `push_str`, `entry` or `chars` would report errors that are not there. So
// every rule below has the same shape - infer both sides, and report only when
// **both are known and they disagree**.
//
// What it therefore promises, exactly:
//
//   * it never rejects a program that is correct;
//   * what it catches grows as the ledger grows, without this file changing.
//
// The second is the point of building it on the ledger (ADR-020) rather than
// beside it. A program's own functions are checked because `Ledger::infer` read
// their signatures out of the source; `std`'s are checked because
// `std.contracts` writes them down; a package's will be because a package ships
// its ledger (Part III, 13.5). One mechanism, three sources.
//
// Spans are the enclosing statement's, as they are for the `sync` check:
// expression-level spans are open work in the parser, and a caret on the right
// line is worth more than none at all.

    // verdict is no longer the same in both** (ADR-045 D1): each asks
    // `contracts::send` about its own destination, and the lock is the type the
    // two answers differ on. Everything else answers alike wherever it is going,
    // so the split costs one argument and changes nothing else.
    //
    // The rule the destination does **not** displace is ADR-038 D7's: a value may
    // cross a thread only if it may cross any thread. What ADR-045 separates is
    // *which* thread is being talked about - one of ours, or one a library we
    // cannot read may start - and each answer is the same at both settings of
    // `user_parallelism`, which is all Group B ever asked. `contracts::send` owns
    // the walk and the reason; these two own the span and the sentence.
    //
    // Both report on `MayNot` and say nothing on `Undecided`, which is
    // `contracts::send`'s module header: refusing what this compiler cannot
    // decide would reject correct programs, and an undecided crossing is not
    // accepted here - `rustc` still type-checks the emitted crate, and
    // ADR-005 D7's `E0277` translation reports that refusal against this same
    // `.nika` line.
    //
    // **A method call is not asked**, and the limit is worth naming: a foreign
    // Rust function is reached by a qualified path (`hyper_shim::serve`), which
    // is what a name-for-name lowering makes callable at all (ADR-011 D2), so
