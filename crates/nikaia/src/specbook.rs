// crates/nikaia/src/specbook.rs
//
// Every `nika` block in the specification, and how far this compiler gets with
// it.
//
// **Why this is a module and not a test.** The walk is needed twice, by
// `tests/specification.rs` and by `examples/specification.rs` that regenerates
// its baseline, and an example is a binary a test cannot call into — the same
// split `dump.rs` and `errors.rs` already have. Putting it here rather than
// copying it keeps one answer to what the specification contains.
//
// **What it is for.** A page can be wrong in a way nothing notices: a program
// printed as an example, never run, and stale from the day a decision changed
// under it. `docs/README.md` §1 already makes a stale **Status** note a defect
// in its own right; this is the same rule applied to the code beside it. Run by
// hand once, it turned up four things — Part I 4.7's `"User: " + self.username`
// (refused twice over), three plain strings holding holes that ADR-035 made
// text, Part I 4.5's map example not compiling, and a trait whose method pauses.
// Run in CI, it keeps them from coming back.
//
// **A block is not always a program**, and the readings below are why this is
// not simply "compile each one". A chapter shows a signature list, a body
// without its function, items without a `main`, or a sketch with `…` where code
// would be. Each reading is tried and the furthest one is what the block is
// recorded as, so a fragment is reported as a fragment rather than as a failure.
