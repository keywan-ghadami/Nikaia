//! **Running a grammar while the program is built is not interpretation**
//! ([`docs/open-work.md`](../../../docs/open-work.md) §2.9, Part II 10.2 A).
//!
//! A grammar could be run here by walking the grammar tree this compiler
//! already holds. **It must not be**, and the reason is not the size of the
//! work. `winnow-grammar` is a code **generator**: its model crate parses the
//! grammar language, validates it, and hands the result to a macro that writes
//! a parser. There is no interpreter in it to borrow — so interpreting would be
//! a **second implementation of the same semantics**, and Part II 10.2's
//! promise that one grammar means the same thing at both stages would stop
//! being a property and become a hope. The disagreements would land in the
//! corners — implicit whitespace, repetition bounds, the commit point, frames
//! and resynchronisation, interning, spans — and would present as *this file
//! parsed while the program was built and fails while it runs*, for the same
//! file and the same grammar.
//!
//! So this compiles the **generated** parser and runs it. Then there is one
//! implementation and the agreement is a tautology rather than a claim.
//!
//! **What it costs is a second compilation**, which [ADR-026](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-026.md)
//! Q4 named. The sub-project is keyed on what went into it, so the cost is paid
//! when the grammar changes rather than on every build. The compiler already
//! emits Rust and already drives Cargo, so the machinery is not new.
//!
//! **And it needs no new security model.** A grammar's action blocks are
//! Nikaia, and [ADR-075](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-075.md) already
//! says what a build-time body may do; the bytes come from `asset("…")`, which
//! [ADR-072](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-072.md) already bounds. What
//! is new here is neither the permission nor the input.
