// Kap 4.7: what an `impl` owes the `trait` it names.
//
// **A walk of its own, and the reason is the ledger's `sync` column.** The type
// checker runs *before* `sync::infer` — that order is what keeps ADR-027 sound,
// because the checker resolves method calls and the inference reads the result —
// so a rule that needs the finished `sync` cannot live inside it. This runs
// afterwards, from `check_program`, beside `dsl::check` and `views::check` and
// for the same reason each of those is separate: it asks a question the type
// walk does not have the answer to.
//
// **Both rules here are refusals that cost nothing today.** Nothing in
// `examples/`, `tests/samples/` or `crates/nikaia-std/src/` declares a trait at
// all — [ADR-078](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-078.md) made the
// declaration possible one commit ago — so this is `open-work.md` §2's own
// principle at its cheapest moment: *a refusal is free before programs exist and
// breaking afterwards*.
