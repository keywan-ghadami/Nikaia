// Stage 0 emits Rust and hands it to `rustc`, which then reports everything -
// its own type errors and the parser backend's frame check alike - against a
// file the user never wrote. That is not a small annoyance: it is the whole
// difference between a compiler and a code generator with a compiler bolted on.
//
// The fix is not a second checker (ADR-011 D3). It is a map: the emitter
// records which `.nika` span produced which byte range of the emitted Rust
// (`emit::SourceMap`), rustc reports byte offsets into that same text with
// `--error-format=json`, and this module trades one for the other.
//
// What it deliberately does not do is rewrite the message. Because the lowering
// is name-for-name (ADR-011 D2), "`until(…)` in rule `NAME` can run through the
// boundary" is already a sentence about the Nikaia source - only its position
// was wrong. Correcting a position is a lookup; translating a text would be a
// second compiler.
