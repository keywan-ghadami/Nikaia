//! Running Nikaia while the program is built
//! ([ADR-073](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-073.md) D5's second stage).
//!
//! `comptime` has had an evaluator since the word existed, and what it knew was
//! an integer literal, a name whose value already folded, a negation and
//! `+ - * / %` — [`fold`](crate::fold), 124 lines with no call in it. That is
//! D5's **first** stage, and the second one was written down as *when Q4 is
//! answered*: a call, and with it the file reading
//! [ADR-072](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-072.md) waits behind.
//!
//! Q4 **is** answered — [ADR-075](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-075.md)
//! D1 and D2 say what a build-time body may do — so this is the call, and with
//! it the **loop**: a `for` over a range, a `while`, `break`, `continue` and an
//! assignment, because a loop that cannot change anything is not one.
//!
//! **What a block means had to grow a third answer.** It used to be *a value or
//! an error*; a loop's body is neither — it runs to its end and produces
//! nothing, which is ordinary — so [`Flow`] names the four ways out and the
//! frame is shared rather than owned, since a `for` has to see what its body
//! assigned on the last turn.
//!
//! **What bounds it is a ledger column and not a list of allowed functions.** A
//! callee must be `sync` (D1) and its touch set must be empty or exactly the
//! build's own parameters (D2), and both are answers the compiler already
//! derives for every function it sees. Nothing here decides what is safe; it
//! reads what was decided.
//!
//! **There is no step budget** (D4), deliberately and with the cost written
//! down: a body that does not terminate hangs the build. What *is* bounded is
//! the **call depth**, and that is a different thing — an unbounded recursion
//! would overflow this compiler's own stack, and a compiler that falls over is
//! not the hang D4 accepted. The limit is high enough that no terminating
//! program meets it and the message says which call path found it.

/// The parser keeps a literal's escapes (`STR_CHAR` takes `\` and any
/// character) and the emitter hands the text to `rustc` unchanged, so **this
/// language's escapes are Rust's**, decided by what that compiler accepts
/// rather than by a page here. Measured: `println("a\qb")` is *unknown
/// character escape: `q`* — on the `.nika` line, which is
/// [ADR-012](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-012.md)'s source map working,
/// and in `rustc`'s vocabulary, which is `open-work.md`'s.
///
/// So this is a **faithful reading** and not a second definition. `None` where
/// the escape is one `rustc` would reject: that program does not compile either
/// way, and the evaluator says *cannot evaluate* rather than inventing a
/// meaning for it.
///
/// [`written`] is the inverse, and `crates/nikaia/tests/build_time.rs` holds
/// the pair to the only standard that settles it: the same literal, read at
/// build time and at run time, printing the same bytes.
