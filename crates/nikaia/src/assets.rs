//! **The files a build may read while it builds**
//! ([ADR-072](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-072.md),
//! [ADR-116](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-116.md) D2).
//!
//! A `comptime` initialiser may write `asset("config.json")`, and what comes
//! back is the file's text. Everything else on this page is about **which**
//! files, and the answer is deliberately hard to give by accident.
//!
//! **A build given no list reads nothing** (D1). That is not a mode a project
//! opts into: it is what happens when nothing is passed, so *this build reads
//! nothing while building* is a fact rather than a claim somebody has to keep
//! true and be believed about. Every other refusal on this page is reached only
//! by a build that already asked for the whole class to be switched on.
//!
//! **A file is named in three places and a read missing any of them is
//! refused** (D3). The flag says a list is in effect; the list says which
//! files; the `asset("…")` literal says which one this line reads. They are
//! deliberately not derivable from one another — the code is where a reader
//! learns what the bytes are *for*, the list is where a reviewer sees the whole
//! set without reading the code, and the flag is where whoever runs the build
//! says the set applies to this invocation. Two of the three are committed, so
//! a change to either is a diff in review; the third is not, which is what lets
//! a build run with the reads switched off without editing anything.
//!
//! **The literal may not be computed** (D4) and **there are no patterns** (D5).
//! Both fall out of D3: if a path could be computed, or stand for files that do
//! not exist yet, *named in the code* would stop being decidable by looking at
//! the line — which is the whole of what the three namings buy. A build that
//! wants ten files lists ten files.
//!
//! **The list binds the whole build, dependencies included** (D6). A package
//! cannot bring its own permission, so a dependency that reads a file makes the
//! consumer write a line for it — which is where the consumer finds out. That
//! friction is the feature.
