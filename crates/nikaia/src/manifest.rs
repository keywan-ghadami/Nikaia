//! `nikaia.toml`'s build switches, and the CLI overriding them for one build.
//!
//! ADR-037 D5 and [ADR-033](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-033.md) D8 give
//! the same shape to all three settings: the manifest carries them, because
//! they are properties of a *project* rather than of an invocation and a
//! committed value is one a reviewer sees; a flag overrides for a single build,
//! which is what a benchmark and a bug hunt need.
//!
//! Nothing here decides what a setting *means* - `emit::Build` and
//! `emit::Ordering` own that, and get handed a string either way. This module
//! only answers "which string", and does it once per run so that two places
//! cannot resolve the same setting differently.
//!
//! It also reads the rest of the manifest, for
//! [ADR-002](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-002.md) D1's translation into
//! a `Cargo.toml`: `[package]`, `[dependencies]` and the per-target codegen
//! tables `[build.<target>]`. One reader, because a manifest read twice is a
//! manifest that can be understood two ways.
