//! Which reference count a particular `Shared` value gets
//! ([ADR-037](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D7).
//!
//! **One rule, and every test here is about it:** *it may only ever take an
//! atomic away.* D6 makes the atomic count the floor, and this analysis is an
//! optimisation on top of it - it may lower a value to a plain count where it
//! **proves** nothing crosses a thread with it, and where it cannot prove that
//! the answer stays atomic. So the tests come in two kinds, and the second kind
//! is the one that matters: the base case, without which an analysis that
//! answered `atomic` for everything would pass every other test in the file;
//! and the fail-closed cases, where being wrong is a data race rather than a
//! missed 9 ns.
//!
//! [`docs/rc-or-arc.md`](../../../docs/rc-or-arc.md) is the experiment this grew
//! out of: what the atomic costs, and the fail-open bug the prototype had - a
//! `<struct>.<field>` slot guarded on "already known", which made the answer
//! depend on the order somebody wrote their functions in. That test is here, and
//! so are its siblings.
//!
//! **Every source here parses and is analysed for real.** `Shared` has no
//! constructor - there is no `Rc::new` or `Arc::new` in the emitter - so a
//! `Shared` can only arrive as a *declared type*, which is exactly how
//! `tests/send.rs` reaches the same type. Nothing is emitted.
