//! `NK2201`: I/O while holding locked data, and the one thing it is about
//! ([ADR-067](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-067.md) D1,
//! [ADR-169](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-169.md)).
//!
//! D1 split Part II 12.2's *no I/O while holding locked data* in two — what
//! **pauses** is `NK2202`'s and what **takes a lock** is `NK2203`'s, and a
//! `println` is the second — and left the third case as a question: *is there
//! I/O that does neither?* It said to answer that before writing a code.
//!
//! The answer is **yes, one**. Of the nine `std` entries whose touch set names
//! I/O, four are the printing functions (`sync`, `locks = true`), four are
//! `fs`'s reads and its write (not `sync`), and one is neither: reading a
//! `fs::Mapped`. A mapping is a file held as memory, so `mapped[i]` is a **page
//! fault** — a disk read with nothing in the source to hang a `touches` on,
//! which neither suspends nor takes a lock.
