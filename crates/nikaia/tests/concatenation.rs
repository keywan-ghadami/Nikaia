//! `a + b` where one side is text
//! ([ADR-081](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-081.md)).
//!
//! **Rust's own rule reached the user unchanged**, and one of the four shapes a
//! program can write compiled:
//!
//! ```text
//! "a" + "b"  →  error[E0369]: cannot add `&str` to `&str`
//! "a" + s    →  error[E0369]: cannot add `String` to `&str`
//! s + "b"    →  compiles
//! s + s2     →  error[E0308]: mismatched types
//! ```
//!
//! The checker got it wrong first, which is the worse half: `"User: " +
//! self.username` came to a `&str`, so a function declaring `-> String` was
//! refused as `NK1104` — a **false** refusal, and
//! [Part III C.4](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md) says this
//! compiler never refuses a correct program.
//!
//! Run rather than read wherever the question is about behaviour: whether a
//! shape works is the language below's answer, and comparing emitted text would
//! only say this compiler agrees with itself.
