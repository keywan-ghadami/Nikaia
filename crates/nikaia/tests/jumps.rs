//! `break` and `continue` — Part I 3.3, unlabelled.
//!
//! Two halves, and they are the two halves of what the construct is:
//!
//! **What it means.** Lowered, compiled as Rust and *run*, for the reason
//! `returns.rs` gives in its own header: both readings of a jump type-check, so
//! a test that only compiled the output would be asserting that the emitter
//! agrees with itself. What a `break` does is visible in what the program
//! prints and nowhere else.
//!
//! **Where it may not stand.** A jump is a machine instruction that moves to a
//! label, and a label in another function is not reachable — so a `break` whose
//! loop is outside a lambda, a task or an `overlap` branch is not a program this
//! compiler may lower. Each of those is a closure or an `async` block below, and
//! without a refusal here the message would be `rustc`'s, about a file nobody
//! wrote (Part III, C.1).
