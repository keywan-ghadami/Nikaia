//! What the C boundary lends: a view, and no raw pointer
//! ([ADR-147](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-147.md) D1).
//!
//! `extern "C" { fn malloc(size: usize) -> Pointer[u8] }` was refused with
//! `NK1135`, and [ADR-124](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-124.md) §4 left
//! it that way on purpose — *a pointer that outlives what it points at wants a
//! record with a lifetime story, not a name.* What that cost was most of C:
//! every function whose signature has a pointer in it was unwritable, so
//! `getpid` compiled and nothing with a buffer did.
//!
//! **The thing to prevent is the dangling dereference**, and D1's answer is
//! that a buffer is a **view** and lives for the call — which is what a view is
//! everywhere else in this language
//! ([ADR-094](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-094.md)). Nothing is stored
//! and nothing escapes, so the shape that dangles cannot be written.
