//! A `for` may iterate something whose step **pauses**
//! ([ADR-172](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-172.md)).
//!
//! The question `docs/open-decisions.md` carried, answered A: the claim is a
//! word on the **type** in the ledger — exactly as
//! [ADR-025](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-025.md) D6's `throws` on a
//! `Seq` already says a step can fail — and the emitter writes the awaiting
//! form for it.
//!
//! **The word is positive and the absence is not it**, which is the whole of
//! D1. A `Seq` that says `sync` does not pause, one that says `pauses` does,
//! and one that says neither is *nobody said* — a `map`'s step runs the
//! lambda, and what that does is the caller's. The two ways of being wrong are
//! not symmetric: awaiting a step that has none is `rustc` refusing a correct
//! program about a file nobody wrote ([Part III
//! C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md), C.4), and holding a
//! thread that could have been given up costs a thread.
