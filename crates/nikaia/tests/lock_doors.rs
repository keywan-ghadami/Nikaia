//! The two refusals that come with the lock's doors
//! ([ADR-099](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-099.md)).
//!
//! [ADR-039](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) D10 gave shared
//! mutable state four doors and stated the two mistakes that come with them.
//! Both were catalogued in Part III Appendix C and raised by nothing, which is
//! the state `open-work.md` §2 calls the one that rots fastest: a rule with no
//! program to be tested against quietly stops being true.
//!
//! **Both are local**, which is why they are these two and not the other three
//! the same entry lists: `NK2201` and `NK2203` need to know what is *inside a
//! door* and what a chain of calls reaches, and `NK2503` needs the reachability
//! walk. These need one statement each.
