//! A name denotes one thing
//! ([ADR-143](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-143.md)).
//!
//! Across files it already was refused
//! ([ADR-047](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-047.md) D1): the files of a
//! package share one namespace, so two `Row`s in it is an error rather than a
//! rule about which of them a line means. Inside **one** file nothing said it,
//! unless the build happened to go through a manifest — and `nikaia --input`
//! skips the module layer, which is the path the corpus, the specification's
//! blocks and a reader's first program all take.
//!
//! **Found by building [ADR-140](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-140.md)
//! D1**, from the case that matters most: a name that is both a type and a
//! function resolves to the type, so `Foo(n: 1)` is `NK1146` and the function is
//! uncallable through the only spelling
//! [ADR-133](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-133.md) D1 gives it — with a
//! help that sends the reader to a line building the struct.
