//! `_` is the ignore pattern
//! ([ADR-126](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-126.md)).
//!
//! `_` existed in one place, a `match` arm. Everywhere else a value arrived it
//! had to be given a name whether or not the body wanted it — a tuple's second
//! half, a parameter a shape dictates, a lambda's argument — and a name nobody
//! reads is a name a reader looks for.
//!
//! **It was also already accepted, and that is what the record is really about.**
//! `_` parsed as an ordinary name, so `let _ = f()` compiled and lowered to
//! Rust's own `let _ =` — which **discards** the value where the source said
//! *bound*. For a file handle or a lock guard those are different programs.
//! `open-work.md` found it; D2 refuses it.
