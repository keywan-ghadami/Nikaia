//! **The touch sets, and the verdict they reach** — what
//! [ADR-033](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-033.md) built and
//! [ADR-050](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-050.md) kept.
//!
//! D1 withdrew the automatic reordering: statements run in the order they are
//! written, and no analysis stands between the source and the schedule. **The
//! analysis survives its original purpose**, because D3 gives it a better one —
//! it no longer decides whether the compiler *may* overlap two statements, it
//! decides whether the programmer was *right* to say so in an `overlap { … }`.
//! Checking a claim is a stronger use of it than making one.
//!
//! So these tests ask the verdict directly rather than through a lowering: what
//! two statements reach, whether they meet, and why not. The construct that
//! consumes the answer is in `overlap.rs`; this file is the vocabulary
//! underneath it, and every entry in it earned its place by being a pair some
//! program in `examples/` wrote.

/// A lambda's own effects are **not** in the statement's touch set, where a
/// `catch` handler's are - and that difference is why `from(f)` stops at `sync`.
///
/// For `sync` and for `throws`, a trailing lambda's body is walked *as part of
/// the function that writes it* (`contracts::sync`'s `visit_expr_blocks`), which
/// is what lets `sync = "from(f)"` be read as "this call adds no pausing of its
/// own": whatever the lambda does is already counted at the call site. This
/// analysis does no such walk - `contracts::order::walk` has no `Expr::Closure`
/// arm - so the lambda's `println` never reaches a touch set at all. The
/// statement is refused instead, which is D4's answer and the right one.
///
/// The contrast is the evidence. `a_handlers_own_effects_are_part_of_the_statement`
/// above refuses its pair **naming `stdout`**, because the handler's write was
/// counted into the statement. Here nothing names `stdout`, with `std`'s ledger
/// or with one where `Vec::sort_by_key` claims `touches = []` outright: the
/// effect was never counted, only stepped around. A `touches = "from(f)"` read
/// the way D3 reads `sync`'s - "adds nothing" - would therefore buy the overlap
/// on an incomplete touch set, and the two `println`s would interleave either
/// way: D1 broken by an effect nobody counted, which is §8.3's handler hole in a
/// third disguise.
///
/// The second source is the one that exercises the refusal itself. A *trailing*
/// lambda today is refused two or three times over - the receiver is not a
/// literal, what the method hands back has no `crosses` line - and those are the
/// two refusals D9's table and ADR-005 §1 Group B call liftable. So the lambda
/// arm is the one that has to hold when they are lifted, and a bare lambda
/// statement is where it can be seen holding on its own.
