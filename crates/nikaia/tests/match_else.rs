//! A `match`'s catch-all arm is `else`
//! ([ADR-145](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-145.md)).
//!
//! The last arm is *everything else*, and it was written with a character
//! borrowed from the ignore pattern — which says something different:
//! [ADR-126](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-126.md) is careful that `_`
//! means **ignore a value that arrived**, neither bind it nor use it, and that
//! record even argues against calling it a *wildcard*. Nothing arrives at a
//! catch-all arm.
//!
//! `else` is what the same idea is called one construct over, is already
//! reserved, and already reads as *the branch taken when nothing before it
//! matched* ([ADR-132](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-132.md)) — so this
//! costs no word, which is most of the argument
//! ([ADR-084](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-084.md)).
