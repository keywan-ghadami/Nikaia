//! A description's **entries** reach the analyses
//! ([ADR-104](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-104.md) D1).
//!
//! D1's first sentence is the whole point of the file it asks for: *every
//! analysis reaches to the boundary and reads an entry there*, and `NK2504`'s
//! own message promises a reader four answers — what may cross a thread, what
//! the call may reach, whether it pauses, whether it can fail — in return for
//! writing it.
//!
//! **For two records it delivered none of them.** `contracts/<crate>.contracts`
//! was read to see whether it *parsed*, the parsed ledger was dropped on the
//! floor, and the file's only effect was silencing the refusal that had asked
//! for it. Measured on a three-line project: a description saying
//! `(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64` left a one-argument call unremarked.
//!
//! So these are the four questions asked of a described boundary, in a project
//! on disk — a manifest, a `contracts/` beside it, and one `.nika` — because
//! `Foreign::of` reads files and a ledger handed in by a test would prove
//! nothing about the wiring.
