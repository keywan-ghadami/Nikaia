//! **A grammar runs while the program is built, by compiling the parser it
//! generates** — [`open-work.md`](../../../docs/open-work.md) §2.9,
//! Part II 10.2 A.
//!
//! **It is not interpreted, and that is the whole entry.** `winnow-grammar` is
//! a code generator with no interpreter in it, so walking the grammar tree here
//! would be a *second implementation of the same semantics* — and Part II
//! 10.2's promise that one grammar means the same thing at both stages would
//! stop being a property and become a hope. The disagreements would land in the
//! corners (implicit whitespace, repetition bounds, the commit point, frames,
//! interning, spans) and would present as *this file parsed while the program
//! was built and fails while it runs*, for the same file and the same grammar.
//!
//! So the tests here **run programs**. A test that compared the emitted `const`
//! against a string would pass for a parser that read the file wrongly, and a
//! test that asked the checker would pass for one that never ran at all.
//!
//! **They are slow on purpose**: each one compiles a small Cargo project. That
//! is the cost [ADR-026](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-026.md) Q4 named,
//! and it is paid once per grammar rather than once per build.
