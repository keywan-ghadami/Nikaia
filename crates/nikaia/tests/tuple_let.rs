//! A `let` takes one name, or a flat tuple of them
//! ([ADR-098](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-098.md)).
//!
//! Part I 8.1.2 writes `let (user, rights, prefs) = overlap { … }` and Part II
//! 12.5 writes `let (tx, rx) = channel::bounded(100)`. Neither parsed: Part I
//! 2.1 introduces `let` with a name and says nothing about a pattern, so the
//! specification used a form twice, for two different constructs, and defined
//! it nowhere.
//!
//! **It is not a pattern language.** `match` has patterns already and neither
//! site needs them; what the two write is a tuple whose arity is known, taken
//! apart by position.
