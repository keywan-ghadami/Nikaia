//! `else if` ([ADR-132](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-132.md)).
//!
//! `if a { … } else if b { … } else { … }` was a parse error — *expected `{`,
//! found `if`* — and every language a reader comes from has it. The examples
//! worked around it with sequential `if`s, which reads as three decisions where
//! there is one.
//!
//! **Nothing is added to the language.** An `else if` is an `else` whose block
//! holds exactly one `if`, with that block's braces left out, so the chain *is*
//! an `if` inside an `if` and every rule of `if` holds at every link. `else if`
//! is two words with whitespace between them, not a keyword.
