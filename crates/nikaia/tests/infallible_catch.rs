//! A `catch` over an expression that cannot fail is `NK1134`
//! ([ADR-091](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-091.md)).
//!
//! The lowering makes a `catch` a `match` over a `Result`, so a guarded
//! expression that is not one produced `E0308` about the generated file, naming
//! a `match` and an `Ok` arm nobody wrote —
//! [Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)'s class.
//!
//! **Every test here is about the polarity**, because the refusal has a way of
//! being wrong that the defect did not:
//! [Part III C.4](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md) forbids
//! refusing a program that is right, and a call no contract describes says
//! *nothing* about whether it throws. So the rule is **known not to fail**,
//! never *not known to fail* — and each shape that this compiler cannot answer
//! for has a test saying it stays quiet.
