//! A call into foreign code from which a **lock** is reachable — `NK2503`.
//!
//! [ADR-039](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) D6 and
//! [Part III 15.2](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md), worked
//! through in C.6: *foreign code touches only what it reaches, and the language
//! has no global mutable data. Where no lock is reachable from the arguments,
//! transitively and through the fields of a struct, the call is allowed and the
//! compiler says nothing.*
//!
//! **The refusal was built and the number was not.** D6 says the check *is*
//! `NK2502`'s walk generalised and never a copy of it, and the walk has been
//! finding locks through fields since ADR-045 D3 — what came out was `NK2502`'s
//! diagnostic, about a value crossing a thread, where Part III C.6 writes a
//! refusal about the **call**. So what is here is one branch at the site that
//! already walks every argument, and these are the sentences it prints.
//!
//! **Which is why `Shared` had to be told from a lock first.** Three things
//! reach the refusing arm now — a lock, a shared count
//! ([ADR-061](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-061.md) D1), and a described
//! type that says `crosses = false` — and only the first is this code. The
//! verdict carries the word; nothing here guesses it from a type's name.
