//! What an always-`Mutex` floor for `Locked[T]` would do to `sync`.
//!
//! **A probe, not a feature**, and it stays one now that the answer is decided
//! ([ADR-057](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-057.md)). Nothing here emits
//! anything; what it does is hold on to the *other* answer's cost, so the
//! decision keeps its evidence rather than only its conclusion. `with_access`
//! therefore takes the shipped entry out before putting a variant in. What it does is put
//! Part II 12.2's open question to the *real* inference
//! ([`contracts::sync`](../src/contracts/sync.rs), ADR-027) instead of arguing
//! it: the one thing an always-`Mutex` floor could break is whether
//! `Locked::access` is still `sync`, and that turns entirely on one line in a
//! ledger.
//!
//! The type checker cannot resolve `counter.access` today (there is no
//! `Locked` type for it to resolve *through*), so its answer is handed in —
//! which is what `sync::infer` takes it as anyway (ADR-028). The library
//! ledger is `std`'s with one entry appended, and the two spellings of that
//! entry are the two answers the floor could take:
//!
//! | the entry | what the floor is claiming | what the inference then says |
//! | :--- | :--- | :--- |
//! | `sync = "from(f)"` | an acquisition adds no pausing of its own | 12.2's idiom is `sync` |
//! | no `sync` line | an acquisition can pause | 12.2's idiom is not, and every caller of it loses the claim too |
//!
//! The finding is in [`docs/mutex-floor.md`](../../../docs/mutex-floor.md).
