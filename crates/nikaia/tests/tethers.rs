//! Which of Part I 6.6's states each view in a signature is in
//! ([ADR-008](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-008.md) D2, D7).
//!
//! **The analysis alone.** Only one of the three states is a representation
//! this compiler emits — Borrowed is the language below's own lifetime, Owned
//! is `.to_owned()` written by the program, and **Tethered is not built**. So
//! this walk changes no lowering: it writes a column, which is D7, and the
