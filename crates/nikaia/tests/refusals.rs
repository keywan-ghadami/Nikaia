//! What leaves the compiler when the **program** is wrong.
//!
//! Part III C.1 says a message about the generated Rust must not reach the user.
//! This is the same promise from the other side: nothing about how this compiler
//! is built may reach somebody who only wrote a program. Both used to leave by
//! the same door and the door was Rust's - a type error in a `.nika` file ended as
//! an `anyhow::Error` out of `main`, so after the diagnostics had said their piece
//! the terminal also got `Error: 1 type error` and, where `RUST_BACKTRACE` is set,
//! ten frames of `nikaia::project::check` and friends.
//!
//! Every test here sets `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`, because that is the state the defect
//! was found in and the state a developer's shell is usually in.
