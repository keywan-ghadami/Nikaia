//! `update` takes `mut v`, changes it in place, and returns nothing
//! ([ADR-110](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-110.md) D1) — the first steps
//! of that record.
//!
//! `kasse.update fn(mut v) { v += 100 }` is the one form. `mut` is
//! [ADR-094](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-094.md) D3's word with its
//! meaning unchanged, one position over: the value is changed in place and the
//! caller whose value changes is the **lock**.
//!
//! **What went with it is the empty slot.** `update` used to move the value
//! out, hand it to the block by value, and move what came back in — so a block
//! that panicked left the lock `None`, a state every other door had to report.
//! D1 takes the cause away rather than the symptom: the block is handed the
//! **address**, nothing is moved out, and no slot is ever empty.
//!
//! **D2's other row is not built.** A value that fits a machine word is meant
//! to be a copy plus a compare-and-swap; here every value takes the address
//! row, so the block runs exactly once. D3 allows that outright — *may* run
//! more than once is a licence, not a requirement — and what is left is speed.
