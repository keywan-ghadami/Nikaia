//! **`comptime`** — Part II 10.2,
//! [ADR-073](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-073.md).
//!
//! The keyword's whole content is a **demand** rather than an ability (D3). The
//! compiler folded constants before this existed — a `let` bound to `2 * 3` is
//! folded twice on the way through ([ADR-063](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-063.md))
//! — so what `comptime` adds is that the fold *has* to succeed, and that a program
//! which cannot be folded is refused rather than quietly computed while it runs.
//!
//! That is what these tests are about, in both directions: what reaches the
//! language below is the **folded value**, and what does not fold reaches the
//! reader as `NK1127`.
