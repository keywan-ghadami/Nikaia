//! A text literal where a `String` is wanted is a `String`
//! ([ADR-207](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-207.md)).
//!
//! `"x"` is a view of static text, and until this record a view put where a
//! `String` was declared was refused until the program wrote `.to_string()` -
//! the refusal every newcomer met first, protecting nothing: the text is a
//! constant, so making a `String` of it is constructing a value, as `[1, 2]`
//! constructs the `Vec` it stands in.
//!
//! **Three halves, and the tests are split the same way.** Where the use keeps
//! the text (a field, an annotated `let`, a `return`, an argument the callee
//! keeps) the literal is constructed there (D2). Where the callee only reads it,
//! the parameter is a `&str` and the literal is handed over as it is, with no
//! allocation at all (D3). And a **view** of text the program has is still
//! refused - that is a copy, and a copy is written (ADR-107 D3).
