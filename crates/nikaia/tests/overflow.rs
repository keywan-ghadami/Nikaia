//! An arithmetic overflow aborts, at every build.
//!
//! [ADR-043](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-043.md) D1. The specification
//! said nothing about overflow, and what the silence cost was measurable: the
//! generated project named one profile, `dev`, so a user's program aborted while
//! every benchmark in this repository runs `--release`, where it wraps. The
//! measurements were taken on wrapping arithmetic and the shipped program
//! aborted. Nobody chose that.
//!
//! **Why this file has three tests and not one.** The check lives in the
//! generated `Cargo.toml` (D6) rather than in the emitted code, so no single
//! test sees the whole of it:
//!
//! 1. the emitted Rust aborts when the check is on — the semantics;
//! 2. the manifest this compiler writes carries the check, and carries it
//!    *off* for every dependency — the setting;
//! 3. the two meet, end to end, through Cargo — the seam, and the only one
//!    that needs the network.
//!
//! Without the third the setting could be correct and unapplied; without the
//! second the third would not say why it passed. The first is what holds if
//! somebody ever reaches for a checked helper per operation, which D6 refuses.
//!
//! **And the conversions, which are a second mechanism** (D4). `as` truncates by
//! definition, so there is no check in the project file to switch on and the
//! answer is in the emitted code instead. The tests for those compile with `-O`
//! and **no** check flag at all - the shipping build, as far as this mechanism is
//! concerned - which is the whole claim: a conversion that does not fit aborts
//! there too.
