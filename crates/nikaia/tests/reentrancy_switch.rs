//! The re-entrancy check is a build option
//! ([ADR-039](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) D8, Part I 1.2).
//!
//! Taking a lock while a lock is held is refused when the program is compiled
//! (`NK2203`, Part II 12.3), so under D2 the runtime check cannot fire in a
//! correct compiler. That is its role: **self-control of D2's rule, not error
//! handling.** No input can trigger it; if it fires, this compiler has a hole,
//! and without it such a hole is a silent hang instead.
//!
//! So it is a guarantee that may be **declined**, which is
//! [ADR-033](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-033.md) D8's precedent: *a
//! semantic default that cannot be switched off is a decision imposed rather
//! than offered.* It lives in the manifest and not on the command line only,
//! because otherwise a shipped build is not reproducible.
//!
//! **Part I 1.2 is untouched by it.** For every program that obeys the nesting
//! rule both builds behave identically; the switch decides only whether a
//! violation is *noticed*, and nothing observable is switched.
