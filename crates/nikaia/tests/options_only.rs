//! An argument list of options alone
//! ([ADR-133](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-133.md)).
//!
//! Part I 5.1 separates a call's **subjects** from its **options** with a `;`,
//! and a function whose only parameters are options was declared
//! `fn execute(; target_age: i64 = 0)` — a semicolon with nothing before it, a
//! shape no reader has seen in any language. The `;` earns its place where it
//! separates two zones; where there is only one zone it separates nothing.
//!
//! **Both halves are built now**, and the call half took a second record to
//! unblock. D3 says *nothing in expression position begins with a name followed
//! by a colon*, and Kap 4.2's struct literal with named fields —
//! `Stats(min: first, max: first)` — was exactly that shape, so this form was
//! read as a literal for a struct nothing declares.
//! [ADR-140](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-140.md) D1 takes that spelling
//! out of the language: `Name { … }` is the literal and `name(field: value)` is
//! a call. Where the name **is** a type, `NK1146` says so and names the braces —
//! which is the one question the parser can no longer answer and no longer has
//! to.
