//! The structural `Send` check - `NK2501` and `NK2502`.
//!
//! [ADR-005](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-005.md) §1 Group B decides it:
//! "`Send`-ness checked **structurally in the frontend** at *every* setting of
//! `user_parallelism`, so a library written at [`no`] cannot turn out
//! un-compilable at [`yes`]".
//! [ADR-037](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) §3 and
//! [ADR-038](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D7 both rely on it, and
//! the experiment in `docs/foreign-runtime.md` is what found it missing.
//!
//! **Two halves, and the first decides whether the tool is worth running.** A
//! check that refuses a correct program is worse than no check, so the corpus is
//! the guard and the deliberately-wrong programs are the proof that the guard is
//! not passing because the check is asleep. The type checker's own corpus guard
//! (`typecheck.rs`) covers these codes too, because they are its findings; what
//! is here is the cases a corpus cannot contain, because nothing in the
//! repository writes `Shared` - `Shared` is unbuilt, and this check is what has
//! to exist before it lands.
//!
//! **Into a task of the program's own, no type *in the language* is refused a
//! crossing** ([ADR-037](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D6,
//! [ADR-045](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-045.md) D2), and that is
//! stated rather than worked around: a lock and a `Shared` both go there at
//! both settings, so the `spawn` programs below assert **silence**.
//!
//! **Into code nothing describes, two of them are refused.** A lock, since
//! ADR-045 D3 — and that one is `NK2503`'s now rather than this file's, because
//! what the refusal is about there is the call
//! ([ADR-039](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) D6, and
//! `reaching_a_lock.rs`). A `Shared`, since
//! [ADR-061](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-061.md) D1 — which was decided
//! and not built, and which this file asserted the *absence* of until
//! `NK2503`'s split went looking for the count.
//!
//! **What does answer *may not* is a described type that says so**
//! ([ADR-123](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-123.md) D1). The ledger's
//! `crosses` column took two values, `true` and absent, so no described type
//! could make the claim and both codes had nothing to fire on for two records'
//! worth of time. `crosses = false` is the third value and the end of that: the
//! two tests at the bottom of this file are the first end-to-end rendering of
//! either code, and `examples/foreign-runtime/`'s handle over an `Rc<String>` is
//! the type that needed it.
