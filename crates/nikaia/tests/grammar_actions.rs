//! A grammar's action may not pause
//! ([ADR-142](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-142.md)).
//!
//! A rule's action is arbitrary Nikaia, so it may call something that pauses —
//! and nothing refused it. The emitter wrote `.await` inside the synchronous
//! parser the `grammar!` macro generates, and the backend answered *`await` is
//! only allowed inside `async` functions and blocks*: its words about a
//! construct this compiler let through, which is
//! [Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)'s class for
//! a shape the language allows.
//!
//! **Found from the other end**, by building
//! [ADR-140](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-140.md) D3: entering a grammar
//! through a path made the entry a call by name, so the analyses read its
//! contract instead of answering nothing about an unresolvable receiver — and
//! the contract carried no `sync`, so every function that parses became
//! `async`. Both answers were answers to a question nobody had asked.
