//! `set(neu; after: seen)` is the one door for a stamped value
//! ([ADR-111](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-111.md) D5).
//!
//! D1 to D4 made a value a lock hands out a `Seen[T]` and refused every `set`
//! that takes one — which left a stamped value exactly one way through, the
//! `update` block, and no way at all to write the *optimistic* form: read,
//! compute outside the lock, store if nothing moved.
//!
//! This is that form, and it is a **definition** rather than a new rule:
//!
//! ```text
//! kasse.set(neu; after: stand)
//! // is
//! kasse.update fn(mut v) { if v == stand { v = neu } else { throw Overtaken } }
//! ```
//!
//! The witness is the value itself. *Store `neu` if the lock still holds what
//! I saw* — and if it does, every decision taken on what was seen still holds,
//! which is why the witness covers both shapes `NK2205` refuses: the stamped
//! value and the stamped condition.
