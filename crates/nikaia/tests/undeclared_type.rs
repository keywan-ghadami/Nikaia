//! A **value** nothing declares has had `NK1117` since
//! [ADR-051](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-051.md) — *"nothing declares
//! `q`"*. A type had nothing, so `let x: Widgit = 3` lowered verbatim and came
//! back as `rustc`'s *"cannot find type `Widgit` in this scope"*, about a file
//! nobody wrote. [Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)'s
//! rule held for one half of this language's names and not the other.
//!
//! **Every test here is about the polarity.** Getting the set of known names
//! wrong refuses a *correct* program, which is the one thing the checker may
//! never do ([Part III C.4](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)) —
//! so each kind of name that must stay silent has a test saying so.
