//! A `for` lends, and a `let` over a place is a view of it
//! ([ADR-094](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-094.md) D4) — the second of
//! that record's five steps.
//!
//! **This one changes what existing programs mean**, which the first step
//! deliberately did not. `for e in entries { … }` used to take `entries` away;
//! it leaves it where it was now, so `entries.len()` on the next line is a
//! program rather than `rustc`'s *use of moved value* about a file nobody
//! wrote. Iteration that takes the elements away is **written** —
//! `for x in xs.drain()` — because removing a name from scope is the rare case
//! and the one worth a word.
//!
//! **Off the shape of the expression and not off a column**, which is why this
//! step needs no ledger: a *place* is lent, and a call, a range or a literal
//! owns what it made. The one question the shape cannot answer is whether a
//! place's value would **move**, and that one the checker answers — `let mi =
//! self.bodies[i].mass` over an `f64` is a copy, and a `&` there is a borrow
//! held across the loop that writes the same field.
