//! A span of time, and the call that waits one out
//! ([ADR-150](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-150.md)).
//!
//! Part II 12.4 wrote `sleep(5.seconds())` and
//! [ADR-141](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-141.md) D2 marked it
//! *unspecified*: the type was not in dispute, only where it lived and how it
//! was spelled. D1 answers `std::time::Duration`, D2 answers *a method on an
//! integer*, D3 answers *and never a suffix on a literal*, and D4 is what the
//! **language** learns from all of it: nothing at all.
//!
//! So what these tests hold is a `std` surface and a runtime promise — five
//! names on either integer type, and a `sleep` that gives the thread up rather
//! than holding it.
