//! What `return` means where it is not the last thing a function does.
//!
//! Part I 7.1: `return` leaves the **function**. Nikaia's blocks are
//! expressions (Part I 3.1), so a `return` can sit at the end of something that
//! is itself a value - a `match` arm, an `if` branch in value position, a
//! `catch` handler, a `seq` block - and there the two readings come apart: the
//! value of the expression around it, or the value of the function past it. The
//! language has one answer and it is the second.
//!
//! **These are run and not read, wherever there is something to run.** The
//! lowering turned `1 => { return 10 }` into `1 => { 10 }`, which is not a
//! broken-looking program: where the types line up it compiles, prints
//! something, and is simply a different program from the one that was written.
//! A test that only compiled it would have passed, and a test that compared
//! emitted text would have been asserting the emitter agrees with itself. So
//! each shape is lowered, compiled as Rust, run, and its output compared against
//! what the source means. The one exception says in its own comment why it
//! cannot be run.
