//! A function type says what a handler may do
//! ([ADR-102](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-102.md) D1 and D2).
//!
//! A parameter could not be a function. The type grammar had a name, a view,
//! type arguments and `?`, so `fn route(path: &str, handler: fn(Request) ->
//! Response)` was a parse error, and the eight `std` entries that take a lambda
//! were written straight into the ledger where the grammar never saw them — a
//! second author could not write `route`, `retry`, `sort_by` or a panic hook.
//!
//! **The type carries two promises and no more** (D2), and their defaults are
//! the language's: without `sync` the code may pause, without `throws` it
//! cannot fail. That is the reading a *declaration* already has, applied to a
//! type — which is why it needs no words of its own.
