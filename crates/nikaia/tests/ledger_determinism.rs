//! `nikaia.contracts` is a pure function of (source tree, toolchain), byte for
//! byte (ADR-005 D8).
//!
//! D8 bans six documented nondeterminism sources and says how the ban is
//! enforced: build twice and compare bytes. The half that matters is **twice in
//! two processes**. A hash map's iteration order is stable within one process
//! and randomised between them, because `RandomState` seeds SipHash per
//! process - so a same-process double run would pass over the one banned item
//! that is easiest to write by accident, and hardest to see in review.
//!
//! The risk D8 names is not the mathematics. A monotone constraint system over
//! a lattice has a unique least fixpoint and solving order cannot change it.
//! The risk is multi-year discipline: any new emit path can smuggle in a
//! hash-map iteration, and this is what makes that a red build on the commit
//! that does it rather than a puzzle a year later.
