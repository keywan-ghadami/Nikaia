//! **`spawn`, and what a task means** — Part I 8.2 and 8.3,
//! [ADR-055](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-055.md) D5.
//!
//! This is what the whole of ADR-055 was written for. `spawn` had no runtime
//! binding because nobody had asked what a task *means* at
//! `user_parallelism = no`: Part II 11.2 says *"interleaved on the same
//! thread"*, and two synchronous Rust closures cannot interleave because
//! neither yields. With the executor (§6 step 1), `async fn` off the ledger
//! (step 2) and `std` suspending for real (step 3), they can — and these are
//! the tests that say so about programs rather than about `std`'s own futures.
