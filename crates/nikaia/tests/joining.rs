//! A block that joins on the executor pauses, and its branches travel in the
//! function's own channel
//! ([ADR-163](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-163.md)).
//!
//! `overlap { … }` and `select { … }` are the two constructs that hand several
//! branches to the executor and wait there. Both were built before
//! [ADR-055](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-055.md) made the lowering
//! `async` and before [ADR-157](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-157.md)
//! gave the failure channel a type, and neither was asked again afterwards. So
//! each of them had a correct program that `rustc` refused, in a file the
//! author never wrote — [Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md):
//!
//! * a block whose branches cannot pause left the enclosing function `sync`,
//!   and the vehicle's `.await` landed in a `fn` that is not `async` (`E0728`);
//! * a fallible branch was wrapped in `Ok::<_, Box<dyn Error>>` whatever the
//!   function's channel was, so the `?` under it could not convert (`E0277`).
//!
//! **These are run rather than read.** Both defects are about what the language
//! below accepts, and comparing the emitted string would say no more than that
//! this compiler agrees with itself.
