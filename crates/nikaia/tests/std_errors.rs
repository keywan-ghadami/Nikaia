//! `std` names what it throws
//! ([ADR-158](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-158.md)).
//!
//! [ADR-023](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-023.md) D1 records `throws` as
//! a **set of error types**, and for every entry in `std`'s ledger that set was
//! `["?"]` — [ADR-024](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-024.md) D1's absence
//! of a claim, standing in for one. A caller read it as *it fails*, which is
//! what the boolean before the column said, so the column added nothing for the
//! one library every program uses.
//!
//! The measurement behind the record is small enough to hold here as a test:
//! **nine** `std` entries throw, two already named `Overtaken`, and the seven
//! that did not all fail with one and the same Rust type. So there is one error
//! type to name, and the specification had already named it — `IoError`, in
//! [ADR-023](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-023.md) D6's worked output and
//! in Part III 13.5's own example row.
