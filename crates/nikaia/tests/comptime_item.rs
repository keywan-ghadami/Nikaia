//! A `comptime` binding where an item stands
//! ([ADR-097](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-097.md)).
//!
//! [ADR-073](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-073.md) D2 decided **both**
//! places and built one: `comptime MAX = 1000` at the top of a file was a parse
//! error while the same line inside a body parsed, folded and ran. Part I 9.2
//! already lists **Constants** among the items `pub` applies to, so the rule for
//! a constant another package may read was written and the syntax for one was
//! not.
//!
//! **What the item form needed that the body form did not** is a frame under
//! every body, filled before any of them is walked: this checker's scope is a
//! stack pushed per function, and an item is visible in its whole scope — a
//! function declared *above* the constant included.
