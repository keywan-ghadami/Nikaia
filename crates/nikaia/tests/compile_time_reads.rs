//! **The files a build may read while it builds** —
//! [ADR-072](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-072.md) and
//! [ADR-116](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-116.md) D2.
//!
//! `comptime CONFIG: &str = asset("config.txt")` puts a file's text into the
//! program while it is built. Everything else here is about **which** files,
//! and the whole of that record is that the answer is hard to give by accident.
//!
//! **The first test is the one a project that never reads anything still
//! wants.** With no list in effect the class is off, so *this build reads
//! nothing while building* is what happens rather than a claim somebody has to
//! keep true. Every other refusal below is reached only by a build that already
//! asked for the whole thing to be switched on.
//!
//! **These tests write files and run the compiler**, because the feature is
//! about files: a test that only inspected the checker would pass for a build
//! that read the wrong one.
