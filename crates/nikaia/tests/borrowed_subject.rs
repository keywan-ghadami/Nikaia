//! A field of a borrowed subject, handed out by value
//! ([ADR-083](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-083.md)).
//!
//! **Part I 6.8 is what decides this**, and it decides it in the language's own
//! words rather than in a judgement of mine:
//!
//! > Ownership rules occasionally reject code […] every such error explains
//! > itself in plain language and tells you what to do next. You never need Rust
//! > knowledge to read a Nikaia error; **if a raw internal (Rust) error ever
//! > reaches you, that is a Nikaia bug.**
//!
//! `return self.username` out of a `ref self` method was exactly that: an
//! ownership rule rejecting code, with `E0507` reaching the user about a file
//! nobody wrote.
//!
//! **The polarity is what these tests are mostly about.** A refusal that fires
//! where it should not is worse than the leak it replaces —
//! [Part III C.4](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md) says this
//! compiler never refuses a correct program — so every shape that worked before
//! is here, run, beside every shape that leaked.
