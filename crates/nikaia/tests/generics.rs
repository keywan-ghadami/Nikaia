//! Part I 4.6's type parameters, built rather than erased

//!
//! **The form parsed and did not compile.** `fn hand[T](x: T) -> T` lowered to
//! `fn hand(x: T) -> T`, because the emitter's header had no slot for a type
//! parameter — so a program that passed every stage of this compiler asked
//! `rustc` about a type nobody had declared, which is Part III C.1's class
//! exactly. These are the programs that page named.
//!
//! The lowering is compiled rather than compared as text, for the reason
//! `nullable.rs` gives: whether `<T>` lands in the right position is settled by
//! the language below, and reading the emitted string would only say that this
//! compiler agrees with itself.
