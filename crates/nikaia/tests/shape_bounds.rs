//! **The two bounds that ask what a type *is*** — Part II 10.3,
//! [ADR-088](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-088.md) D2 and D3.
//!
//! `[T: Struct]` is not a trait anybody declares and no `impl` answers it. What
//! answers it is the **declaration**, which is the whole of D2: the bound is
//! what makes a type's shape reachable, and it is reachable because the
//! compiler has read the `struct` line.
//!
//! **What D3 buys is one whole class of failure moved to the call.** Zig's
//! `anytype` is the counter-example the record cites: the signature says
//! nothing, so a caller learns that its type does not fit only when something
//! deep in the body fails to compile, with the message pointing into somebody
//! else's code. `NK1164` answers *you passed something that is not a struct*
//! where the call is.
//!
//! **And the bound does not travel.** Rust has no trait called `Struct`, so one
//! written into the generated file would come back as *cannot find trait
//! `Struct` in this scope* — [Part III
//! C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)'s class, and the hole
//! this package would have opened if the emitter had not been told.
