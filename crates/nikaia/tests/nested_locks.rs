//! A lock taken while a lock is held is refused
//! ([ADR-039](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) D2, `NK2203`).
//!
//! Part II 12.3 called manual nesting an anti-pattern and *"often a
//! compile-time error"*. D2 makes *often* into **always**, and with that no
//! program exists in which a lock's two representations behave differently —
//! which is the whole reason `user_parallelism` may pick one.
//!
//! **The chain is what needed a column.** A second lock written inside the
//! block is one line to see; one reached three calls deep is not, and
//! `contracts::locks` propagates *touches a lock* over the call graph so that
//! both are the same answer here.
//!
//! **A `println` is one of these**, and it is the case
//! [ADR-067](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-067.md) D1 was written about:
//! it never pauses, so `sync` says nothing about it, and it takes standard
//! output's own lock while yours is open. Two conditions and not one.
