//! A loop that cannot end needs no unreachable `return`
//! ([ADR-093](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-093.md)).
//!
//! [ADR-070](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-070.md) D3: a function that
//! genuinely never returns — an accept loop, an event loop, a supervisor — had
//! to end with a `return 0` that cannot be reached, and a reader of that line
//! could not tell dead code from a mistake.
//!
//! **Two tests, not one**, and the second is the one
//! [ADR-084](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-084.md) added: before `break`
//! existed, the condition was the whole question. Now a `while true` a jump
//! leaves is a loop that ends, and the shape is a walk of the body rather than
//! a look at the head.
