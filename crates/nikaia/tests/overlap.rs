//! **`overlap { … }`** — Part I 8.1.2,
//! [ADR-050](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-050.md) D2–D6.
//!
//! The one way a program asks for overlap, now that
//! [ADR-050](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-050.md) D1 has withdrawn the
//! automatic half. What makes it worth a form of its own is D3: **every
//! mainstream construct for "run these together" takes the programmer's word
//! for the independence, and this one checks it** — against the touch sets
//! [ADR-033](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-033.md) built for the
//! inference that D1 removes. That machinery is kept and asked the other way
//! round: not *"may I reorder these?"* but *"you said these overlap; is that
//! true?"*
