//! `extern "C"` and `unsafe`, the two words Part III 15.1 writes
//! ([ADR-124](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-124.md)).
//!
//! The page wrote C interoperability out in full and the language had **none**
//! of the three things the example needs: `extern` was not reserved and the
//! item was not in the grammar, `unsafe` was not reserved either — so
//! `unsafe { … }` parsed as a name and a block and met `NK1117` — and
//! `Pointer[u8]` is a type nothing declares, which is still true and is that
//! record's §4.
//!
//! **The number that allowed two reserved words is zero.** Nothing in
//! `examples/`, in `tests/` or in the three pages wrote either as a name, and
//! nothing is released — which is [ADR-084](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-084.md)'s
//! own standard, and the reason they are reserved **with their constructs**
//! rather than ahead of them ([ADR-117](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-117.md)).
