//! **`value with { field: … }`** — [ADR-118](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-118.md),
//! Part I 4.2.
//!
//! A copy of a value with named fields changed. The braces are the struct
//! literal's, with its field list and its shorthand, so almost nothing here is
//! new: what the record adds is one postfix rule, the field resolution against
//! the **operand's** type, and a lowering to Rust's functional update.
//!
//! **The operand is the whole of what is new.** `Point { x: 1, ..p }` writes
//! the type, and this node does not carry one — so the checker records what it
//! worked out and the emitter reads it back, which is the handover a
//! `comptime`'s value already makes
//! ([ADR-011](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-011.md) D2). A `with` this
//! compiler could not name a type for is refused rather than guessed at, and
//! that is why the emitter's lookup cannot fail.
