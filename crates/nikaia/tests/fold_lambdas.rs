//! A grammar fold's `init`, `step` and `merge` are walked by the whole checker
//! ([ADR-092](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-092.md)).
//!
//! They are expressions inside a **pattern**, and the grammar walk took a
//! rule's *action block* and nothing else — so `fn(acc, m) { undeclared }`
//! lowered without a word and `|acc, m| { undeclared }` reached `rustc`, which
//! answered about a file nobody wrote
//! ([Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)).
//!
//! [ADR-084](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-084.md) D4 had closed the half
//! a **jump** can reach, with a walk of its own over these same three
//! expressions and deliberately no more. That walk is gone: the ordinary
//! `Expr::Closure` arm already crosses a boundary and counts loops from zero,
//! so one walk now answers both — and gives the jump the better of the two
//! messages.
