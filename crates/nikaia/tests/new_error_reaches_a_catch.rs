//! An error that newly reaches a `catch` is named once — `NK2402`
//! ([ADR-101](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-101.md)).
//!
//! Every failure in a Nikaia program is caught or declared, and a `catch`
//! handles **everything** that reaches it. `throws` names no types at a
//! signature, so the set arriving at a handler is open: it grows whenever a
//! callee gains a failure. The handler is then still a correct program and
//! still handles the new error — as it handles everything.
//!
//! **What was missing is not a refusal. It is that nobody was told.** So this
//! is a warning, printed and stopping nothing, and given **once**: the commit
//! of the ledger diff is the acknowledgement, and after it the new set is the
//! baseline.
//!
//! *And the record's own §5 said it could not be built yet* — *`std.contracts`
//! writes `throws = ["?"]` on every entry, so there is no set to diff*. That
//! stopped being true when [ADR-158](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-158.md)
//! gave `std` its error type: the file has nine `throws` lines now, seven of
//! them `io::IoError` and two `Overtaken`, and **not one** is `["?"]`. What is
//! left of that spelling is a **grammar** rule's entry, which is
//! `open-work.md` §2.13 and a question on `open-decisions.md`.
