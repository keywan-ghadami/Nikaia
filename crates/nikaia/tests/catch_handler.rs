//! A `catch` that ignores the error binds `_error`
//! ([ADR-090](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-090.md)).
//!
//! Kap 7.1 gives the failure the name `error` whether or not the handler reads
//! one, so `catch { 1000 }` — the shape Part I 7.1 teaches first — used to reach
//! the author as `warning: unused variable: error` about a binding that exists
//! nowhere in their program. That is
//! [Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)'s class one
//! severity down: the message is `rustc` reading the emitted code correctly, and
//! the only name in it is one the emitter invented.
//!
//! **The polarity is what these tests are for.** A false *"the handler mentions
//! it"* keeps yesterday's binding and yesterday's warning; a false *"it does
//! not"* writes `_error` under a handler that reads `error`, and that is a
//! program which does not compile. So every shape that mentions the name is
//! checked to still bind it — a hole, a nested block, a `let` that only passes
//! it on — and the one shape that merely *looks* like it (`errors`) is checked
//! not to.
