//! **`from` is an ordinary name** —
//! [ADR-116](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-116.md) D1 and D3.
//!
//! It was reserved for `dsl X from e`, a form [ADR-082](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-082.md)
//! removed. What a reservation buys is one sentence — the one a reader who
//! writes the word gets — and the sentence for a removed form is a `fail` in
//! the grammar, which needs the **token** and not the reservation. The two are
//! different things, and this file is about telling them apart.
//!
//! It is also the most common name on the list: Part III 17.1 writes
//! `pub fn rename(from: Path, to: Path, root: Root)`, and that declaration did
//! not parse.
