//! A name the **language below** reserves, written in every position this
//! language has one ([ADR-076](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-076.md)).
//!
//! `let type = 3` used to lower to `let type = 3;` and `rustc` answered
//! *"expected identifier, found keyword `type`"* about a file nobody wrote, with
//! *"escape `type` to use it as an identifier"* as the help — advice that means
//! nothing in this language, which is
//! [Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)'s class.
//!
//! **The sweep is the coverage proof and that is why it is shaped like this.**
//! An escape applied at the position that *declares* a name and missed at the
//! position that *refers* to one is worse than no escape at all: the program
//! then fails for a reason that is harder to read than the one it started with.
//! Arguing that every position was found is not the same as showing it, so every
//! word goes through every position and the result is handed to `rustc`.
