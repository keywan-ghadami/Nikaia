//! The runtime, from the outside: one program, both mechanisms, same answer.
//!
//! [ADR-038](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-038.md) D3 says a file may be
//! served by the kernel's completion queue or by the blocking path, and that
//! **which one is chosen is a run-time decision**. The claim that carries is
//! not that either mechanism works - the unit tests in `nikaia-std` say that -
//! but that *one compiled binary* runs on both and prints the same thing. A
//! binary built on a machine with `io_uring` has to run on one without it, and
//! the only way to know is to force each route through the same executable.
//!
//! D4's half is checked here too, on the emitted Rust: `fn main` is the
//! runtime's, the program's own `main` is called from inside it, and which
//! pool starts is `user_parallelism`'s answer rather than the operator's.
