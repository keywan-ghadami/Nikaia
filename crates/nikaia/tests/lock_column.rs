//! Which functions **touch a lock**
//! ([ADR-039](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-039.md) D3) — the second
//! derived property, propagated over the call graph `sync` uses and with the
//! opposite lattice.
//!
//! The column alone: inferred, recorded, and read by nothing. Every refusal
//! that entry lists — `NK2201`, `NK2203` — is still uncatalogued work, and the
//! point of landing this half on its own is that the answer can be **measured**
//! against the corpus before one of them reads it.
//!
//! **That measurement is why the column has three values and not two.** D3
//! says fail-closed, and it says it about `sync`, where the cost of doubt is a
//! caller writing `.await`. Taken literally here it gave the property to **16
//! of 59** functions in `examples/` — almost all of them `main`, and not one of
//! those programs opens a lock. A refusal reading that column would have
//! refused correct programs, which is the one thing
//! [Part III C.4](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md) forbids. So
//! `Undecided` is its own answer, exactly as it is in
//! [`contracts::send`](../../src/contracts/send.rs): not permission, and not a
//! refusal either.
