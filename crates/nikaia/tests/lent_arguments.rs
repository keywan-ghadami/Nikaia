//! The compiler writes the `&` at the call
//! ([ADR-094](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-094.md) D1 and D2 together) —
//! the third of that record's five steps, and the one the first two were built
//! for.
//!
//! Step 1 inferred the `keeps` column and let nothing read it. Step 2 made a
//! `for` lend. This step joins the two ends: a parameter the callee only
//! **reads** is declared `&T` below and given its `&` at every call, so
//! `page(entries)` is the line and `page(&entries)` is refused. **One answer in
//! two positions** — `contracts::keeps::lends`, read by the emitter when it
//! writes the declaration and by the checker when it writes the argument —
//! because the two disagreeing is a `&&T` or a moved value in the language
//! below, which is `rustc` talking about a file nobody wrote
//! ([Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)).
//!
//! **Most of this file is about the claim being withheld.** The rule is a
//! rewrite of what every existing call means, so the tests that matter are the
//! ones where it must not fire: a kept parameter, a copy type, an argument
//! that is already a view, a method's argument, a callee no ledger describes.
//! A version of this rule that lent everywhere would compile this file's first
//! test and break the language.
