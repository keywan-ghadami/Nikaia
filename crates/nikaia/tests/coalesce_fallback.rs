//! A `??`'s fallback is one value, or an expression in brackets
//! ([ADR-089](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-089.md)).
//!
//! **`??` sat above the whole binary chain**, so its fallback reached rightwards
//! across every operator there is: `a ?? 0 > 3` was `a ?? (0 > 3)` while looking
//! like `(a ?? 0) > 3`. `open-work.md` carried that as a **suspicion**, because
//! the shape it had produced a type error rather than a wrong answer, and
//! whether both readings could ever type-check was *precisely what had not been
//! established*.
//!
//! It can. With `a: bool?`, `x: bool`, `y: bool`, the line `a ?? x == y` reads
//! both ways and the answers differ — measured at `false` where the line looks
//! like `true`. That is a silent wrong value, which is the worst thing in
//! `docs/README.md`'s list, so it stopped being a suspicion.
