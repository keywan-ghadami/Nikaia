//! The ADR-038 D7 experiment, kept re-runnable.
//!
//! D7 says a Rust crate may bring its own runtime and its own threads, and
//! names two rules that keep that sound. `examples/foreign-runtime/` is the
//! program that tests them: a Nikaia project depending on a shim crate over
//! `hyper` and `tokio`, through ADR-002 D1's crates.io passthrough. What the
//! experiment found is written up in `docs/foreign-runtime.md`.
//!
//! **One test here runs on every `cargo test`** - the one that needs neither
//! Cargo nor the network, and which is the one that checks a guarantee rather
//! than a finding: a call into a foreign crate has no ledger entry, so ADR-033
//! D4 makes it order against everything.
//!
//! **The rest are `#[ignore]`d**, because each one runs `cargo`, and the first
//! run fetches `hyper`, `tokio` and twenty-four other crates from crates.io.
//! Run them with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test foreign_runtime -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
