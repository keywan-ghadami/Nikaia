//! **Generating code from a type's shape** — Part II 10.3,
//! [ADR-088](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-088.md) D2, D4, D5 and D6,
//! built by [ADR-181](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-181.md).
//!
//! That section was specified in full and built by halves: the **bound** landed
//! at 0.0.120 and what it reaches was `NK1171` — *this is specified and this
//! compiler does not have it* — until 0.0.129.
//!
//! **These tests run programs.** What an unrolling produces is a question the
//! language below answers: a test that compared the emitted Rust against a
//! string would pass for a copy that read the wrong field, and one that asked
//! the checker would pass for a loop that was never unrolled at all.
