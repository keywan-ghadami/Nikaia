//! Compiling emitted Rust from inside a test.
//!
//! A generated program links `nikaia_std`, `winnow_grammar` and `winnow`, and
//! all three are in cargo's deps directory - along with other copies of them:
//! the build-dependency graph builds the parser backend a second time under a
//! different Cargo profile, and an earlier build may have left a stale hash behind.
//! Two copies of `winnow` in one program is a type error at every `Stream`
//! bound, so guessing by modification time is not good enough.
//!
//! The copies that belong together are named in the crate metadata: an rlib
//! lists its dependencies as `name-hash`, and the hash is the one in the
//! file name. So one anchor - the newest `nikaia_std`, of which a build has
//! exactly one - and the rest is read, not guessed.
//!
//! **Read with nothing unstable.** A dependency's `extra-filename` is a plain
//! string *inside* the metadata, so the question is answered by asking it the
//! other way round rather than by asking the compiler to list anything: of the
//! candidate rlibs on disk, which one's filename hash appears in the anchor's
//! bytes. Exactly one may, and the helper refuses to guess if that is not so.
