//! Every `nika` block in the specification, taken as far as it goes.
//!
//! **A page can be wrong in a way nothing notices.** A program printed as an
//! example, never run, stale from the day a decision changed under it.
//! `docs/README.md` §1 already makes a stale **Status** note a defect in its own
//! right; this is the same rule applied to the code beside it.
//!
//! It exists because running the blocks by hand once turned up four things, and
//! two of them were on the page rather than in the compiler: Part I 4.7's
//! `return "User: " + self.username` was refused twice over — the checker said
//! it hands back a `&str` where `String` is declared, and the lowering would not
//! have compiled either — and three plain strings in Part I 7 held `{p}`,
//! `{line}` and `{expected}`, written before
//! [ADR-035](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-035.md) made only `f"…"`
//! interpolate. Both are fixed; this is what stops them coming back.
//!
//! **The baseline records fragments and refusals too**, and that is deliberate.
//! A chapter shows signature lists, bodies without their function, and sketches
//! with `…` where code would be, so "every block compiles" is not the property —
//! *nothing changed without somebody reading the diff* is. A block that stops
//! lowering shows up as a changed line, and so does one that starts.

/// direction that matters — a change that quietly turns programs back into
/// fragments, which the baseline would also show and which a count says out
/// loud.
///
/// Raise it when it is beaten. That is the point of a floor.
///
/// **Lowered once, from 52 to 48**, and the reason is written here because a
/// floor that moves down needs one. `NK1135`
/// ([ADR-096](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-096.md)) refuses a type
/// nothing declares, and four blocks that used to lower name one. They are
/// three different things and only the first is the sweep's own doing:
///
/// * **`impl User` and `-> Config`** declare their type in a *neighbouring*
///   block, and this sweep compiles each block separately.
/// * **`NotFound(Path)`** and, in a block already refused for another reason,
///   `-> List[Row]`: `Path` and `List` are names the specification writes as
///   types and `std` does not publish. `fs::map`'s parameter is `?` because
///   Rust's is `impl AsRef<Path>`, and the language's sequence is `Vec`, which
///   is what `ListExt` is implemented for.
/// * **`fn total(p: &Player)`** names a type the specification declares
///   **nowhere at all** — as do `Object` and `SqlParser`.
///
/// So the direction this guards against is not the direction it moved: these
/// are not programs quietly turned back into fragments, they are fragments the
/// compiler had been accepting because it could not read a type name. A count
/// cannot tell those apart, which is why the number is a floor and the sentence
/// beside it is the actual guard.
///
/// **Lowered a second time, from 50 to 49.** Part II 10.1's `grammar Json`
/// writes a rule's action as the block after the pattern, with no second
/// arrow ([ADR-120](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-120.md) D2), and the
/// parser does not take that form yet — so the page is ahead of the compiler
/// by decision, which is the state every unbuilt record leaves its examples
/// in. The block comes back as a program with ADR-120 §5's first step, and
/// the floor goes back up with it.
///
/// **Lowered a third time, from 49 to 48**, for the same reason — and **raised
/// back** once the parser caught up. Part III 15.1's
/// `script.exec(msg: message)` writes a call whose arguments are all options
/// without the leading `;`
/// ([ADR-133](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-133.md) D1); the block is a
/// program again, which is the *one* thing a floor is for. Its call half waited
/// on [ADR-140](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-140.md) D1, because
/// `execute(target_age: 30)` and the named struct literal `Stats(min: first)`
/// were the same five tokens.
///
/// **Lowered a fourth time, from 48 to 47, and this one is the floor going
/// down because the compiler got better.** Part I 9.1's second block writes
/// `Row(id: helper() + 1)` for a `Row` its *first* block declares — the
/// sentence on that page is that files in a package see one another with no
/// `use` — and this harness hands each block over alone. It used to lower and
/// come back from `rustc` as `E0422`, *cannot find struct `Row`*, about a file
/// nobody wrote; it is now `NK1135` in this compiler's own words
/// ([ADR-096](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-096.md), and the silence that
/// let [ADR-133](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-133.md)'s collision
/// through). Blocks 28, 62 and 64 were already recorded that way for the same
/// reason. **A block that stops lowering because it is refused *here* is the
/// C.1 class closing**, which is why this number went down and nothing is
/// wrong: what it counts is programs this compiler hands to the backend, and
/// one fewer wrong answer arrives from there.
///
/// **Raised, from 47 to 48**, by ADR-133's call half — Part III 15.1's block,
/// above. That is what the floor is for, and the sentence is here because the
/// four before it are.
///
/// **Raised again, 48 to 49**, by [ADR-140](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-140.md)
/// D3. Part II 10.2's `fn parse_input` entered its grammar through a **dot**,
/// which made `Json` a name nothing declares (`NK1117`); `Json::value(input)`
/// is a path and resolves. The block beside it, 10.3's `describe[T: Struct]`,
/// moved the other way and is the reason the number is 49 and not 50: with
/// `T::fields` a path rather than a dotted receiver, the `NK1117` that used to
/// refuse it was gone and the block reached `rustc`, which answered *cannot
/// find trait `Struct`* about a file nobody wrote. It is `NK1135` now — the
/// same claim one position over, for a **bound** naming a trait nothing
/// declares — so the block is refused in this compiler's words rather than
/// counted as a program.
