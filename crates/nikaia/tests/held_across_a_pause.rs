//! What a task **binds** and then holds across a pause
//! ([ADR-055](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-055.md) §2 D6's third sharp
//! edge).
//!
//! `NK2501` has always asked its question of what a task **captures**. A task's
//! body is an `async` block below, so a value bound *inside* it and still live
//! at a suspension point further down is held **inside the future** — and the
//! pool's starter asks for `Send` of that whole future. Until now the only
//! thing that said so was the backend, about the generated file, which
//! [Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md) calls a bug
//! in this compiler.
//!
//! **The refusal is silent today and that is why it was built.** No type
//! answers `MayNot` at `Destination::Ours` — `Shared` stopped being one when
//! [ADR-037](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-037.md) D6 gave it one
//! representation at both settings, and a lock is `MayNot` only at a *foreign*
//! destination. A refusal costs nothing before there are programs it would
//! reject, and the same refusal added afterwards breaks them.
//!
//! **So what these tests hold is the liveness half**, which is the half that
//! can be wrong. The verdict is a lookup; *bound before a pause and named after
//! it* is a computation, and a computation nothing can see the answer of is one
//! nothing can check. `Checked::held_across_a_pause` is that answer.
