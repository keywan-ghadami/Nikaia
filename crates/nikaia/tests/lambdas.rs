//! The trailing lambda, with its arguments named.
//!
//! Part I 5.3 offers a lambda two spellings of the same form: implicit
//! arguments (`fn { a.id }`) or named ones (`fn(user) { user.id }`). In
//! expression position the parser took both. In *trailing* position - the
//! lambda outside the call's parentheses - it took only the implicit one, so
//! every named example in the specification was read as two expressions: the
//! call without its last argument, and a closure nobody passed anywhere. That
//! type-checks in Rust often enough to be a different program rather than an
//! error, which is why these are compiled and not only compared as text.
//!
//! **The stand-ins.** A trailing lambda's callee is usually something `std`
//! does not have yet - a lock's `access`, `access_all`, `task::scope`. ADR-028
//! D5 keeps an entry out of `std` until a program asks for it, so each test
//! that needs one prepends the Rust it stands for. What is under test is the
//! grammar and the lowering: that the emitted call is a well-formed Rust call
//! whose last argument is the closure.
