//! The inference graph is the **package**, not the file
//! ([ADR-100](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-100.md) D2).

//! Every derived column is a fixpoint over a call graph, and until this the
//! graph stopped at the file boundary: `reach_of` found a callee in the file
//! next door in neither `own` nor `std` and set `blocked`. `Sync::No` spells
//! that *"can pause **or** could not be vouched for"*, and every reader takes
//! the first — so `NK1129` refused a trait method for calling a plain function
//! two lines away in another file, `throws` came out `"?"` where the neighbour
//! names its error, and `touches` came out *"everything"* where the neighbour
//! says what it reaches.
//!
//! **The polarity is what these tests are for.** Making an analysis answer
//! where it could not is only correct if it still declines where it should, so
//! every test that shows a claim arriving has a twin showing the claim withheld
//! — a genuinely pausing neighbour is still `NK1129`, and a neighbour outside
//! the package is still unresolved.
