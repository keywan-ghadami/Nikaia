//! **A map whose keys the build knew** —
//! [ADR-176](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-176.md).
//!
//! These tests **run** the program, and that is the point of them rather than
//! a preference. The table is built twice by two programs that never meet:
//! `crates/nikaia/src/fixed.rs` decides where each key lands while the compiler
//! runs, and `crates/nikaia-std/src/fixed.rs` finds it again while the program
//! runs. Two implementations of one hash function, in two crates, with no type
//! holding them together — so a test that only looked at the emitted `const`,
//! or only at what the checker said, would pass for a table that answers every
//! lookup with its neighbour's value.
//!
//! A lookup is only right if it comes back with the right number. So the tests
//! below compile the file and print what it found.
