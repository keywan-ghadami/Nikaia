//! `mut` on a parameter: in-place change is written in the declaration
//! ([ADR-094](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-094.md) D3) — the fourth of
//! that record's five steps.
//!
//! `fn fill(mut out: Vec[i64])` is a parameter the callee changes in place, and
//! the **caller's** value is what changes. It lowers to `&mut T`, and the call
//! — `fill(xs)` — shows nothing, exactly as `xs.push(1)` shows nothing. A
//! language that hides mutation through a receiver and shows it through an
//! argument has two rules for one thing.
//!
//! **The third state, and the only one of the three the author writes.** D1's
//! `&` comes off the inferred `keeps` column and D2's *handed over* is what is
//! left; this one is a word in the source, and `keeps::lends` withholds its own
//! claim on such a position so the two never both write a reference.
//!
//! **And it closes a hole older than the record.** A body that changed an owned
//! parameter lowered to a Rust declaration with no `mut` on it, and `rustc`
//! answered *cannot borrow as mutable* about a file nobody wrote
//! ([Part III C.1](../../../docs/specification/30-nikaia-tooling.md)). That is
//! `NK1138`, and half the tests here are about it landing only where the change
//! is **certain** — the other half of C.1 is C.4, and a correct program refused
//! is the worse of the two mistakes.
