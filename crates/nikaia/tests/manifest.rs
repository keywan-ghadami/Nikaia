//! The build switches come from `nikaia.toml`, and a flag overrides them
//! (ADR-037 D5).
//!
//! `manifest.rs`'s own unit tests hold the precedence rule. What is checked
//! here is the half those cannot see: that the resolved value actually reaches
//! the emitter, so a committed `user-parallelism = "yes"` is a property of the
//! project and not a comment in a file nothing reads.
//!
//! **There are two switches again** ([ADR-050](../../../docs/specification/adr/adr-050.md)
//! D7): `ordering` went with the reordering it turned off, and Part I 1.2's
//! *"there are exactly two things to choose"* is true once more, having been
//! three.
