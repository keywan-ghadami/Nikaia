//! The Rust half of the ADR-038 D7 experiment: a crate that brings its own
//! runtime and its own threads, wrapped in a surface a Nikaia program can call.
//!
//! Everything here is deliberately plain. What the experiment is after is what
//! the *Nikaia* side can and cannot say about a call into this, so this file
//! must not be clever - except in [`across_a_thread_unchecked`], which is
//! clever on purpose and says why.
